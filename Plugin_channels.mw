'''Plugin channels''' are implemented using [[Protocol#0xFA|packet 0xFA]], allowing client mods and server plugins to communicate without cluttering up chat. [http://dinnerbone.com/blog/2012/01/13/minecraft-plugin-channels-messaging/ This post by Dinnerbone] is a good introduction and basic documentation.
{{anchor|Internal}}
== Reserved channels ==
=== <code>REGISTER</code> ===
''Two-way''

Allows the client to register for one or more custom channels, indicating that the server should send data on those channels if the appropriate plugin is installed. Payload is a null (\00) separated list of strings.

=== <code>UNREGISTER</code> ===
''Two-way''

Allows the client to unregister from one or more custom channels, indicating that the server should stop sending data on those channels. Payload is a null-separated list of strings.

== Channels internal to Minecraft ==
As of 1.3, Minecraft itself started using plugin channels to implement new features. These internal channel names are prefixed by <code>MC|</code>. They are not formally registered using the REGISTER channel. The vanilla Minecraft server will send these packets regardless, and the vanilla client will accept them.

=== <code>MC|BEdit</code> ===
''Client to server''

When a player edits an unsigned book.

This payload is simply a set of bytes corresponding to an ItemStack. It is serialized / deserialized exactly the same as itemstacks in packets.

=== <code>MC|BSign</code> ===
''Client to server''

When a player signs a book.
This payload is simply a set of bytes corresponding to an ItemStack. It is serialized / deserialized exactly the same as itemstacks in packets.

=== <code>MC|TPack</code> ===
''Server to client''

Remote texture packs.
This contains a string representing the url to get the texture pack from, followed by null (\0000) and then '16', all in ASCII.

===  <code>MC|TrList</code> ===
''Server to client''

The list of trades a villager NPC is offering.

=== <code>MC|TrSel</code> ===
''Client to server''

When a player selects a specific trade offered by a villager NPC.
It contains a single int id corresponding to the selected slot int the players current (trading) inventory.

== Notable community plugin channels ==
Channels listed in this section are not Mojang-sanctioned. This is just a likely-incomplete list of channels used by mods/plugins popular within the Minecraft community.

=== <code>ML|OpenTE</code> ===
''Server to client''

Used by [http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/75440-v132-risugamis-mods-preliminary-updates/ ModLoader] to support custom GUI windows. Does not use the REGISTER channel.

=== <code>WECUI</code> ===
''Two-way''

Used by the server-side [http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/worldedit/ WorldEdit] and the client-side [http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/885099-131-worldeditcui-gui-visualizer-for-worldedit-v131/ WorldEditCUI] to coordinate selections.
