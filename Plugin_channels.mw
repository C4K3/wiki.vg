'''Plugin channels''' are implemented using [[Protocol#0xFA|packet 0xFA]], allowing client mods and server plugins to communicate without cluttering up chat.

As of 1.3, Minecraft itself started using plugin channels to implement new features. These internal channel names are prefixed by <code>MC|</code>.

The payload starts with the following unknown sequence: 01-82-01-00-00
Next follows a length-prefixe(int16) that is the size of the remaining GZip-ed NBT-data.

=== <code>MC|BSign</code> ===
''Client to server''
