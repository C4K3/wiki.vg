'''Plugin channels''' are implemented using [[Protocol#0xFA|packet 0xFA]], allowing client mods and server plugins to communicate without cluttering up chat. [http://dinnerbone.com/blog/2012/01/13/minecraft-plugin-channels-messaging/ This post by Dinnerbone] is a good introduction and basic documentation.

== Channels internal to Minecraft ==
As of 1.3, Minecraft itself started using plugin channels to implement new features. These internal channel names are prefixed by <code>MC|</code>.
=== <code>MC|BEdit</code> ===
''Client to server''

When a player edits an unsigned book.

This payload is simply a set of bytes corresponding to an ItemStack. It is serialized / deserialized exactly the same as itemstacks in packets.

=== <code>MC|BSign</code> ===
''Client to server''

When a player signs a book.
This payload is simply a set of bytes corresponding to an ItemStack. It is serialized / deserialized exactly the same as itemstacks in packets.

=== <code>MC|TPack</code> ===
''Two-Way''

Remote texture packs.

===  <code>MC|TrList</code> ===
''Two-Way''

The list of trades a villager NPC is offering.

=== <code>MC|TrSel</code> ===
''Client to server''

When a player selects a specific trade offered by a villager NPC.
It contains a single int id corresponding to the selected slot int the players current (trading) inventory.

== Notable community plugin channels ==
Channels listed in this section are not Mojang-sanctioned. This is just a likely-incomplete list of channels used by mods/plugins popular within the Minecraft community.
