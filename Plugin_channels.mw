'''Plugin channels''' allow client mods and server plugins to communicate without cluttering up chat. [http://dinnerbone.com/blog/2012/01/13/minecraft-plugin-channels-messaging/ This post by Dinnerbone] is a good introduction and basic documentation.
{{anchor|Internal}}
== Reserved channels ==
=== <code>REGISTER</code> ===
''Two-way''

Allows the client or server to register for one or more custom channels, indicating that data should be sent on those channels if the receiving end supports it too. Payload is a null (<code>0x00</code>) separated list of strings.

=== <code>UNREGISTER</code> ===
''Two-way''

Allows the client or server to unregister from one or more custom channels, indicating that the receiving end should stop sending data on those channels. Payload is a null-separated list of strings. This is only useful if plugins are disabled/unloaded while the client is connected.

== Channels internal to Minecraft ==
Since 1.3, Minecraft itself uses several plugin channels to implement new features. These internal channel names are prefixed by <code>MC|</code>. They are '''not''' formally registered using the REGISTER channel. The vanilla Minecraft server will send these packets regardless, and the vanilla client will accept them.

=== <code>MC|AdvCmd</code> ===
{{anchor|MC.7CAdvCdm}}''Client to server''

Sets the contents of a command block or command block Minecart.  The Notchain client only uses this for command block minecarts and uses [[#MC.7CAutoCmd|<code>MC|AutoCmd</code>]] for blocks, but the Notchian server still accepts it for either.

In 1.8 and earlier the name of this channel was incorrectly spelled as <code>MC|AdvCdm</code>.  This was fixed in snapshot {{Minecraft Wiki|15w34a}}.

The packet starts with a single byte, which determines the type of thing being edited (block or minecart).  If it is 0, then it is a block and the location is 3 ints; if it is 1, then it is a minecart and the location is the entity's EID as an int.

=== <code>MC|AutoCmd</code> ===
''Client to server''

Sets command block contents.  This can only be used to edit command blocks; command block minecarts cannot be used with it.  To edit a command block minecart, use [[#MC.7CAdvCmd|<code>MC|AdvCmd</code>]].

=== <code>MC|BEdit</code> ===
''Client to server''

When a player edits an unsigned book.

This payload is simply a set of bytes corresponding to a [[Slot Data|Slot]].

The [[NBT]] section of the Slot contains

<pre>
TAG_Compound(<nowiki>''</nowiki>): 1 entry
{
  TAG_List('pages'): 2 entries
  {
    TAG_String(0): 'Something on Page 1'
    TAG_String(1): 'Something on Page 2'
  }
}
</pre>

=== <code>MC|BOpen</code> ===
''Server to client''

When a player right clicks with a signed book. This tells the client to open the book GUI.

The payload is a VarInt enum for the selected hand: 0 for the main hand, 1 for the offhand.

=== <code>MC|BSign</code> ===
''Client to server''

When a player signs a book.

This payload is simply a set of bytes corresponding to a [[Slot Data|Slot]].

The Item ID in the Slot should be a Written Book

The [[NBT]] section of the Slot contains

<pre>
TAG_Compound(<nowiki>''</nowiki>): 3 entires
{
  TAG_String('author'): 'Steve'
  TAG_String('title'): 'A Wonderful Book'
  TAG_List('pages'): 2 entries
  {
    TAG_String(0): 'Something on Page 1'
    TAG_String(1): 'Something on Page 2'
  }
}
</pre>

=== <code>MC|Beacon</code> ===
''Client to server''

Two integers corresponding to the 2 effects a user wishes to have active.

=== <code>MC|Brand</code> ===
''Two-way''

Announces the server and client implementation name right after a player has logged in. For the Notchian client and server server, this is "vanilla" (encoded as a [[Data Types|protocol string]]: a UTF-8 string with the length prefixed as a VarInt).

These brands are used in crash reports and a few other locations; it's recommended that custom clients and servers use changed brands for the purpose of identification (for the Notchian client, the class used to get the brand is one of the few non-obfuscated classes).  The brand is not processed in any other way, and Notchian clients will connect to servers with changed brands with no issue (the brand is not used to validate).

The Notchian server sends a <code>MC|Brand</code> packet right after it sends a [[Protocol#Join_Game|Join Game]] packet, and the Notchian client sends it right after receiving a Join Game packet.  However, some modified clients and servers will not send this packet (or will take longer to send it than normal), so it is important to not crash if the brand has not been sent.  Additionally, the brand may change at any time (for instance, if connected through a BungeeCord instance, you may switch from a server with one brand to a server with another brand without receiving a Join Game packet).

=== <code>MC|DebugPath</code> ===
''Server to client''

[[File:MC-DebugPath_in_16w14a.png|thumb|What appears to be the purpose of <code><nowiki>MC|DebugPath</nowiki></code> as seen in the [http://mojang.com/2016/04/minecraft-snapshot-16w14a/ snapshot 16w14a announcement].  This is ''not'' found in the normal game.]]

Never sent, but does something with pathfinding debugging.  The client reads the data and stores it, but its renderer cannot be enabled without modifications.

=== <code>MC|ItemName</code> ===
''Client to server''

Sent as a player is renaming an item in an anvil (each keypress in the anvil UI sends a new <code>MC|ItemName</code> packet).  The payload is optional, and if not sent (IE, the length of the packet is 0 bytes) or if the new name is empty, then the item loses its custom name (this is different from setting the custom name to the normal name of the item).  The item name may be no longer than 30 characters long, and if it is longer than that, then the rename is silently ignored.

{| class="wikitable"
 ! Field name
 ! Field type
 ! Notes
 |-
 | Item name
 | Optional String
 | The new name of the item
 |}

=== <code>MC|PickItem</code> ===
''Client to server''

Used to swap out an empty space on the hotbar with the item in the given inventory slot.  The Notchain client uses this for pick block functionality (middle click) to retrieve items from the inventory.

Payload is a single varint, which is the slot in the inventory to grab from.

The server will first search the player's hotbar for an empty slot, starting from the current slot and looping around to the slot before it.  If there are no empty slots, it will start a second search from the current slot and find the first slot that does not contain an enchanted item.  If there still are no slots that meet that criteria, then the server will use the currently selected slot.

After finding the appropriate slot, the server swaps the items and then send 3 packets:

* [[Protocol#Set slot|Set Slot]], with window ID set to -2 and slot set to the newly chosen slot and the item set to the item that is now in that slot (which was previously at the slot the client requested)
* Set Slot, with window ID set to -2 and slot set to the slot the player requested, with the item that is now in that slot and was previously on the hotbar slot
* [[Protocol#Held_Item_Change_.28clientbound.29|Held Item Change]], with the slot set to the newly chosen slot.

=== <code>MC|PingHost</code> ===
''Client to server''

Sent ''after'' a Server list ping in Minecraft 1.6. More information on [[Server List Ping#1.6]]. In 1.7 and above, the [[Protocol#Request|Request]] ([[Protocol#Status|Status]], 0x00, serverbound) packet is instead sent ''before'' the ping.

{{Warning|Since this plugin channel is only sent for the legacy server list ping, it uses the older packet structure.}}}

=== <code>MC|StopSound</code> ===

Used to implement {{Minecraft Wiki|Commands#StopSound|the <code>/stopsound</code> command}}.  Stops a sound that is currently playing on the client.

{| class="wikitable"
 ! Field name
 ! Field type
 ! Notes
 |-
 | Sound name
 | String
 | A [http://pokechu22.github.io/Burger/1.11.html#sounds sound effect name].  If left empty, ''all'' sounds are stopped.
 |-
 | Sound category
 | String
 | Should be one of the sound categories used in [[Protocol#Named Sound Effect|Named Sound Effect]], but if it's invalid or empty then it is (intentionally) treated as ''all'' sound categories.
 |}

Emptiness of sound category or sound name can be combined, IE a empty sound name but a set sound category will stop all sounds in the given category.

=== <code>MC|Struct</code> ===

''Client to server''

Sets information about the {{Minecraft Wiki|Structure block}}.
