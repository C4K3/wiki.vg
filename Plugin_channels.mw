'''Plugin channels''' are implemented using [[Protocol#0xFA|packet 0xFA]], allowing client mods and server plugins to communicate without cluttering up chat. [http://dinnerbone.com/blog/2012/01/13/minecraft-plugin-channels-messaging/ This post by Dinnerbone] is a good introduction and basic documentation.
{{anchor|Internal}}
== Reserved channels ==
=== <code>REGISTER</code> ===
''Two-way''

Allows the client to register for one or more custom channels, indicating that the server should send data on those channels if the appropriate plugin is installed. Payload is a null (\00) separated list of strings.

=== <code>UNREGISTER</code> ===
''Two-way''

Allows the client to unregister from one or more custom channels, indicating that the server should stop sending data on those channels. Payload is a null-separated list of strings.

== Channels internal to Minecraft ==
As of 1.3, Minecraft itself started using plugin channels to implement new features. These internal channel names are prefixed by <code>MC|</code>. They are not formally registered using the REGISTER channel. The vanilla Minecraft server will send these packets regardless, and the vanilla client will accept them.

=== <code>MC|AdvCdm</code> ===
''Client -> Server''

Adventure mode command block. 

The first byte is ''type'' which is followed by either:

{| class="wikitable"
! Type !! Field Name !! Field Type !! Notes
|-
| rowspan=4 | 0x00
| X || Int || 
|-
| Y || Int || 
|-
| Z || Int || 
|-
| Command || String ||
|}

or

{| class="wikitable"
! Type !! Field Name !! Field Type !! Notes
|-
| rowspan=2 | 0x01
| Entity ID || Int ||  
|-
| Command || String ||
|}

depending on the ''mode''

=== <code>MC|Beacon</code> ===
''Client to server''

Two integers corresponding to the 2 effects a user wishes to have active.

=== <code>MC|BEdit</code> ===
''Client to server''

When a player edits an unsigned book.

This payload is simply a set of bytes corresponding to an ItemStack. It is serialized / deserialized exactly the same as itemstacks in packets.

=== <code>MC|BSign</code> ===
''Client to server''

When a player signs a book.
This payload is simply a set of bytes corresponding to an ItemStack. It is serialized / deserialized exactly the same as itemstacks in packets.

=== <code>MC|ItemName</code> ===
''Two-way''

When a player uses an anvil to name an item. The payload is just a string: the item's new name.

=== <code>MC|RPack</code> ===
''Server to client''

Remote resource packs.
This contains a string representing the url to get the resource pack from.

===  <code>MC|TrList</code> ===
''Server to client''

The list of trades a villager NPC is offering.

=== <code>MC|TrSel</code> ===
''Client to server''
	
When a player selects a specific trade offered by a villager NPC.
It contains a single int id corresponding to the selected slot int the players current (trading) inventory.

=== <code>MC|PingHost</code> ===
''Client to server''

Sent after a Server list ping. More information on [[Server List Ping]]

=== <code>MC|Brand</code> ===
''Two-way''

Announces the server and client implementation name right after a player has logged in. For Minecraft and the standard Minecraft server, this is "vanilla" (encoded as a UTF-8 string).

== Notable community plugin channels ==
Channels listed in this section are not Mojang-sanctioned. This is just a likely-incomplete list of channels used by mods/plugins popular within the Minecraft community.

=== <code>BungeeCord</code> ===

Strings in this channel are UTF8 strings prefixed with a short for length.

The first string is the ''SubChannel'' follow by the following depending on the value of ''SubChannel''
