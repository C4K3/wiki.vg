[http://charged-miners.com Charged Miners] is a client for classic, download the launcher [https://github.com/downloads/Charged/Miners/Charged%20Miners.exe here]

== Improvements ==
* Add extension protocol.
* XBox 360 gamepad support (triggers are on the same axis thanks to MS's driver)
* Save last few messages typed into the console, and allow using up/down arrows to scroll through them (like you would in a terminal).
* Water cosmetic improvements: specularity, volumetric fog underwater, etc.
* More chat/terminal improvements (being able to move cursor around with arrow keys, selection with shift key, etc).
* Lighting mode faithful to Minecraft Classic (straight-down shadows), to allow viewing pixelart properly.
* Extend movement speed config separate entries for normal horizontal and vertical speeds, and for sped-up horizontal and vertical speeds.
* Make key mappings more easily configurable.
* Ability to bookmark/favourite/sticky servers in the serverlist, keeping them at the top.
* Clickable links in game chat.


== Launcher ==
* <s>Button/Menu item to open the %AppData%/Roaming/charge folder.</s> - Done in 1.1
** <s>Bonus Objective: Button/Menu item that uploads log.txt to a paste site.</s> - Done in 1.1
* Add a list of recently-joined/favorite servers.

== Bugs ==
* Player models lack hats.
* "gfx" eats 95% of time (realtime, not CPU time) if vsync is enabled.
* There is no application icon on Windows for CM.
* Intel graphics cards doesn't get smooth textures.
* Alt-tabbing out of the game window sometimes keeps the mouse focus stolen.


== Done ==
* <strike>Make walking/running speeds configurable and create an entry in the configuration file allowing to adjust the movement speed.</strike>
* <strike>Player should be able to go above the map (beyond the map boundary) even when NoClip is disabled.</strike>
* <strike>Optional/toggle-able collision detection with terrain.</strike>
* <strike>Non-flying player movement code.</strike>
* <strike>Expose more options through in-game menus.</strike>
* <strike>The default skin is completely white.</strike>

* <strike>Ignores terrain.classic.png and doesn't load textures from terrain.png (classic) correctly unless manipulateTextureClassic(pic); is commented out (line 306, miners/startup.d) (Tested on Linux 3.5.4-1 x86_64, nvidia-304.51)</strike>
**Works for me, make sure you put terrain.classic.png somewhere it can find it.
* <strike>Charged Miners doesn't report the same player location to the server as the official client (though the official client may be in error).</strike> Not a bug.
* <strike>Half steps make the underside of the block above them transparent.</strike>
* <strike>Admincrete is delete-able by non-ops.</strike>
* <strike>With viewdistance Furthestest, ghost clones of the players on the same map as you can be seen far down below the world.</strike>
* <strike>--resume argument that connects to last connected to server.</strike>
* <strike>Bringing up chat should release the mouse.</strike>
* <strike>Water surface becomes invisible when underwater.</strike>
* <strike>Individual water blocks are clickable (unlike vanilla Minecraft water blocks), which makes underwater building very difficult.</strike>
* <strike>Ability to paste text while typing (Ctrl+V or Shift+Ins).</strike>
* <strike>Turn on the ability to resize the window by default (at least on Windows).</strike>
* <strike>Add ability to part a server after joining, to go back to the server list.</strike>
