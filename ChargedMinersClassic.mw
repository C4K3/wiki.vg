[http://charged-miners.com Charged Miners] is a client for classic, download the launcher [https://github.com/downloads/Charged/Miners/Charged%20Miners.exe here]

== Improvements ==
* Optional/toggle-able collision detection with terrain.
* Non-flying player movement code.
* Expose more options through in-game menus.
* Save last few messages typed into the console, and allow using up/down arrows to scroll through them (like you would in a terminal).
* Water cosmetic improvements: specularity, volumetric fog underwater, etc.
* More chat/terminal improvements (being able to move cursor around with arrow keys, selection with shift key, etc).
* Lighting mode faithful to Minecraft Classic (straight-down shadows), to allow viewing pixelart properly.
* Create an entry in the configuration file allowing to adjust the movement speed.
** Ideally separate entries for normal horizontal and vertical speeds, and for sped-up horizontal and vertical speeds.
* XBox 360 gamepad support (triggers are on the same axis thanks to MS's driver)
* Clickable links

== Bugs ==
* Intel graphics cards doesn't get smooth textures.
* Interpolate other players' movement.
* Player models lack hats.
* Charged Miners doesn't report the same player location to the server as the official client (though the official client may be in error).
** Yeah, I'm pretty sure Charged Miners is consistent while classic is not. --[[User:Wallbraker|Wallbraker]] ([[User talk:Wallbraker|talk]]) 03:10, 24 September 2012 (MST)
