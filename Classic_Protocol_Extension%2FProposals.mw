===PlaySound===
:Proposed by !!!WARLOCK!!!
:This extension allows server to play custom sound and musics on client.
:'''Motivation''': Servers can play custom musics or sound effects just in time or when something changes. Useful for gamemodes such as zombie survival, Servers can play zombie moaning sound while zombies are close to players. Player join and leave sounds, Kill streak sounds for games such as CTF, Radio and DJ class for players and sound effects for explosions and player deaths.
:'''Client Behavior''': Client must download and load, or load the sound directly from the URL with the ID. Client must be able to download any time after MapFinalize has sent. If the URL is empty then the Client must unload the sound with that ID. Client must unload the sound and load a new one if there's a sound with existing ID. Client must be able to play the sound right after receiving the PlaySound packet. The last playing sound can not be ignored or stopped when a new sound is going to be played. Files type must be in .WAV, otherwise they're ignored. Client must ignore downloading the existing files from Server if they're saved in drive. Client must not change the volume of all environments (Place/Destroy, Walk sounds) on SetVolume packet. Client must change a local variable for volume of next playing sound on SetVolume packet.
:'''Server Behavior''': Server must ignore sending the same url multiple times. Server can not send quick loops of sound due to network speed and client crash possibility. It's better to load all of required sounds after map load for better performance. Server must not send high sized file cause of time and speed it takes for download. Files type must be in .WAV, otherwise they're ignored. Server can change the volume before playing a sound. For a better networking, It's suggested to not send PlaySound instead of changing volume to zero.

===ClientRedirection===
:Proposed by [[User:Sysr q|Sysr q]] ([[User talk:Sysr q|talk]]) 10:17, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
:This extension allows servers to give clients a ''redirection'' to a separate, possibly "private" server.
:'''Motivation''': Allowing servers to redirect clients would be useful in several cases. Allowing a singular "hub" server to redirect players to various external (but related) servers depending on the gamemode they wish to play would allow tightly integrated networks. If servers are using an external "balancer" or some sort of Minecraft-aware proxy, the server could signal the proxy move its connection on the client's behalf to another server.
:'''Client Behavior''': Clients should be ready to receive a '''''ClientRedirection''''' packet any time after they receive a '''''LevelFinalize''''' packet. When clients receive a '''''ClientRedirection''''' packet, they should prompt the user with a message indicating the server they're being redirected too, and allow the user to continue or quit. Non-player clients (e.g., proxies) have the option of silently reconnecting on the client's behalf. Clients should then open a new connection to the newly redirected server, and begin standard negotiation protocol.
:'''Server Behavior''': Servers should only send a '''''ClientRedirection''''' packet after the they have sent a '''''LevelFinalize''''' packet. They should ensure the new server the client is being redirected to exists, and preferably is online and available.

===ColorCodeControl===
:Proposed by [[User:F|F]] ([[User talk:F|talk]]) 22:00, 28 August 2014 (UTC)
:Gives servers an option to allow players to type in color codes, and a way to render <code>&</code> character in chat.
:'''Motivation''': Allow players to type in color codes and to use & in chat.
:'''Client Behavior''': When this extension is mutually supported, treat character sequence <code>&&</code> as meaning "draw an <code>&</code> character", without modifying current color. Do not allow <code>&</code> to be typed or pasted into chat unless '''''ColorCodeControl''''' packet has been received with ''AllowColorCodes'' set to <code>1</code>.
:'''Server Behavior''': When this extension is mutually supported, server may send '''''ColorCodeControl''''' packet to allow client to type or paste color codes. Server should treat <code>&&</code> as described above.

===UnicodeChat===
:Proposed by [[User:F|F]] ([[User talk:F|talk]]) 22:48, 28 August 2014 (UTC)
:Expands character encoding beyond ASCII. There are three ways to go about this:
:# Expand charset to 256 characters using '''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252 Win-1252]'''.
:#* <span style="color:#060">'''Pro'''</span>: Easiest to implement in clients (few changes to FontRenderer needed) and servers (no multibyte character support needed).
:#* <span style="color:#060">'''Pro'''</span>: No new packets needed.
:#* <span style="color:#060">'''Pro'''</span>: Easy to create custom fonts.
:#* <span style="color:#060">'''Pro'''</span>: Easy for servers to maintain compatibility with legacy clients, since only 128 characters need to be remapped, most of which have decent ASCII matches.
:#* <span style="color:#060">'''Pro'''</span>: Low resource use (low RAM and VRAM use, no additional CPU use, small font file).
:#* <span style="color:#c00">'''Con'''</span>: Still only 256 characters. Only covers Latin-derived (English and Western/Central European) languages and common symbols.
:# Expand charset to Unicode [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Multilingual_Plane#Basic_Multilingual_Plane Basic Multilingual Plane] (BMP) with '''UCS-2''' fixed-length encoding.
:#* <span style="color:#060">'''Pro'''</span>: Lots of characters (~65k) covering most languages and symbols.
:#* <span style="color:#060">'''Pro'''</span>: Not too hard to implement (characters still fixed-width, native support in WinAPI / Java / C#).
:#* <span style="color:#060">'''Pro'''</span>: Free fonts available that covers all characters.
:#* <span style="color:#c00">'''Con'''</span>: New renderer (possibly third-party library) needed for rendering.
:#* <span style="color:#c00">'''Con'''</span>: Higher resource use (higher RAM and VRAM use, more CPU use, large font file).
:#* <span style="color:#c00">'''Con'''</span>: Very hard to create custom fonts.
:#* <span style="color:#c00">'''Con'''</span>: Still does not cover all characters.
:#* <span style="color:#c00">'''Con'''</span>: Hard for servers to maintain compatibility with legacy clients.
:#* <span style="color:#c00">'''Con'''</span>: Always uses 2 bytes per character for transmission (twice as much as ASCII/CP-1252).
:# Expand charset to Unicode [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Multilingual_Plane#Basic_Multilingual_Plane Basic Multilingual Plane] (BMP) with '''UTF-8''' variable-length encoding.
:#* <span style="color:#060">'''Pro'''</span>: Lots of characters (~65k) covering most languages and symbols.
:#* <span style="color:#060">'''Pro'''</span>: Not too hard to implement (characters can be freely converted to/from UCS-2, which is natively support in WinAPI / C#).
:#* <span style="color:#060">'''Pro'''</span>: Free fonts available that covers all characters.
:#* <span style="color:#060">'''Pro'''</span>: Uses 1 byte per character for transmission, most of the time.
:#* <span style="color:#c00">'''Con'''</span>: New renderer (possibly third-party library) needed for rendering.
:#* <span style="color:#c00">'''Con'''</span>: Higher resource use (higher RAM and VRAM use, more CPU use, large font file).
:#* <span style="color:#c00">'''Con'''</span>: Hard to create custom fonts (unless some fallback rules are implemented).
:#* <span style="color:#c00">'''Con'''</span>: Still does not cover all characters.
:#* <span style="color:#c00">'''Con'''</span>: Hard for servers to maintain compatibility with legacy clients.
:# Expand charset to full Unicode with '''UTF-8''' variable-length encoding. Includes all the supplemental Unicode planes.
:#* <span style="color:#060">'''Pro'''</span>: Widely used in other software.
:#* <span style="color:#060">'''Pro'''</span>: Theoretically covers all languages and symbols.
:#* <span style="color:#060">'''Pro'''</span>: Uses 1 byte per character for transmission, most of the time.
:#* <span style="color:#c00">'''Con'''</span>: Does not ''actually'' cover all languages and symbols due to non-existence of 100% fonts.
:#* <span style="color:#c00">'''Con'''</span>: Hard to find free fonts that extend beyond the BMP.
:#* <span style="color:#c00">'''Con'''</span>: Harder to work with strings (due to variable-width characters).
:#* <span style="color:#c00">'''Con'''</span>: Third-party library needed for rendering.
:#* <span style="color:#c00">'''Con'''</span>: Highest resource use (highest RAM and VRAM use, most CPU use, largest font files).
:#* <span style="color:#c00">'''Con'''</span>: Hardest to implement (no native support in WinAPI / C#).
:#* <span style="color:#c00">'''Con'''</span>: Hard to create custom fonts (unless some fallback rules are implemented).
:#* <span style="color:#c00">'''Con'''</span>: Hard for servers to maintain compatibility with legacy clients.

===ColorControl===
:Proposed by !!!WARLOCK!!!
:Changes the color alpha (A) of Messagetypes to a custom number.
:'''Motivation''': Allows servers to make gradient/glass like text messages at Message Type's IDs.
:'''Client Behavior''': If this packet is received, Client should directly change the alpha color of the specified chat message into a custom number. If the default message ID `0` is received, client should be changing the alpha code of the all incoming and received chat lines into the specified number. The alpha code remains until the client disconnects from the server, and should be functional with all incoming and already received messages. Client should be able to receive this message after the Initial map load.
:'''Server Behavior''': Server can send this packet to clients right after client finished loading the initial map. Message type can be any of stated/defined numbers on the packet (Message Type).

===SelectionCuboid v2===
:Proposed by FabTheZen, classic1234 and Rayne
:'''Motivation''': Allows the server to not only highlight parts of a world, but also determine whether those regions are walk through or not. This could be used to disallow players to walk inside restricted areas or zones which they are not allowed to build in. It could also be used as a jail when accompanied with the '-hax' option.
:'''Client behavior''': The client must receive the SelectionCuboid extension with version 2. It must also determine whether any selections on the map walk through or not.
:'''Server behavior''': The server behaves the same way SelectionCuboid v1 does.

===Player Animation===

:'''Client Behavior''': On recieve the client should perform the actions required for the animation.
:'''Server Behavior''': The server may send the packet if needed any time after the map is send.

===PlayerHealth===
:Proposed by [[User:Apotter96|Apotter96]] ([[User talk:Apotter96|talk]]) 02:29, 26 July 2015 (UTC)alex96
:Gives players life count that is controlled by the server and reflected by the client at the top left of the game screen. The server.
:'''Motivation''': RPG and Gun games can go more extensive if they wish with lives.
:'''Client Behavior''': Display player's lives at the top left of screen when the server sends the packet. On player connect, the server needs to tell the client the max amount of lives the player can have, in between 5 and 20. May also dictate how many lives the server is allowed to send. Both need to check with the other end so they can comply together.
:'''Server Behavior''': At any time the server can send the packet telling the client the amount of lives the player has. Once a player connects, the server needs to tell the client how many lives the player is allowed to have, in between 5 and 20. Both need to check with the other end so they can comply together.

===ExtPlayerList v3===
:Proposed by Cheesse
:This extension builds upon the current version and adds the ability to change the visibility of name tags.
:'''Motivation''': Provides more flexibility in naming of players and loading of skins, autocompletion, and player tab-list display. Separates tracking of in-game entities (spawned player models) and names on the player list. '''''ExtAddPlayerName'''''/'''''ExtRemovePlayerName''''' packets take over managing the player names list (tab-list), and '''''ExtAddEntity3'''''/'''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|DespawnPlayer]]''''' packets are used only to manage in-game entities.Provides more flexibility in naming of players and loading of skins, autocompletion, and player tab-list display. Separates tracking of in-game entities (spawned player models) and names on the player list. '''''ExtAddPlayerName'''''/'''''ExtRemovePlayerName''''' packets take over managing the player names list (tab-list), and '''''ExtAddEntity3'''''/'''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|DespawnPlayer]]''''' packets are used only to manage in-game entities.
:'''Client Behavior''': When '''''ExtAddPlayerName''''' packet is received for an unused ''NameID'', a new name must be added to the player-name list. When receiving '''''ExtAddPlayerName''''' packet for an already-listed ''NameID'', client must update its ''ListName'', ''GroupName'', and ''GroupRank''. Names on the player-name list should be grouped by ''GroupName'' in the player-name list. Names within a ''GroupName'' should be sorted by ''GroupRank'' (in ascending order). Names with the same ''GroupName'' and ''GroupRank'' should be sorted alphabetically by ''ListName''. Color codes may be either drawn or stripped from ''ListName'', ''GroupName'', and ''InGameName''. Player-name list must persist when client changes worlds/maps.

:When an '''''ExtAddEntity3''''' packet is received, it must be treated as the '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|SpawnPlayer]]''''' packet. A player model must be spawned in-game at the given location, with ''InGameName'' text drawn above it. Skin should be loaded using the given ''SkinName'' for a player name. If ''SkinName'' appears to be a player name, skin should be downloaded from the default skin server. If ''SkinName'' appears to be a full URL to a PNG image (starts with <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code> and ends with <code>.png</code>) then skin should be downloaded from that URL. If image is correctly sized/proportioned to use as a skin for the current model, it should be used. If a blank or unrecognized value is given for ''SkinName'', or if given image could not be downloaded or used, then the default skin should be used. The client must also set the visibility according to ''NameVisibility'' and the collision ability of the entity according to ''CanCollide''. When client receives '''''ExtAddEntity3''''' packet for an already-spawned player, a duplicate entity must not be spawned and existing entity's position must not be changed. Instead their ''InGameName'',  ''SkinName'', ''NameVisibility'', and ''CanCollide'' attributes must be updated. If a negative ''EntityID'' is given for '''''ExtAddEntity3''''', client must update player's own spawn point, ''InGameName'', and ''SkinName''. If any undefined value is given in the ''NameVisibility'' or ''CanCollide'' fields, the client should ignore these fields. The client must ignore regular '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|SpawnPlayer]]''''' packets, if any are received.

:When a standard '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|DespawnPlayer]]''''' packet is received for a recognized ''EntityID'', player model must be removed from a world. When '''''ExtRemovePlayerName''''' packet is received for a recognized ''NameID'', their name must be removed from player-name list. Packets with out-of-range or unrecognized ''NameID''s must be ignored.

:In-game entities must never be affected by '''''ExtAddPlayerName''''' or '''''ExtRemovePlayerName''''' packets. Player name list must never be affected by '''''ExtAddEntity3''''' or '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|DespawnPlayer]]''''' packets.
:'''Server Behavior''': Unique ''NameID'' between 0 and 255 should be assigned to every online player or every player on a map for each map. When a new player connects to the server or joins a new map, '''''ExtAddPlayerName''''' must be sent. ''GroupName'' and ''GroupRank'' can be used in any way, for example to group players by map/world or rank/class/faction. Server must use '''''ExtAddEntity3''''' in place of standard '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|SpawnPlayer]]''''' packet. Server should re-send '''''ExtAddPlayerName''''' packet, using the identical ''NameID'', when player's ''ListName'', ''GroupName'', or ''GroupRank'' change. Server must reliably send an '''''ExtRemovePlayerName''''' packet when the player disconnects. Color codes are permitted in ''ListName'', ''GroupName'', and ''InGameName''.

:''This extension only replaces the ExtAddEntity2 packet of the ExtPlayerList extension version 2. Thus, only the ExtAddEntity3 packet is shown here.''

===HackControl v2===
:Proposed by Cheesse
:This extension allows more control over the abilities of players.
:'''Motivation''': To gain control over the movement and action abilities of players.
:'''Client Behavior''': Client must be able to receive '''''HackControl2''''' packets at any time and apply the changes defined in the packet immediately. Any value may be given in any field to allow or adjust an ability. If a negative value is given in any field, the client should set that value to its default. If <code>0</code> is given in any field, the client must deactivate that ability and prevent its use by the player unless otherwise stated.
:'''Server Behavior''': Server may send '''''HackControl2''''' packets to successfully connected clients at any time.

===EnvWeatherType v2===
:Proposed by Cheesse
:This extension allows the server to change the weather conditions and amount of fog.
:'''Motivation''': To allow the server to create a setting, scene or mood on a map; or to limit the players vision for things like smoke bombs in games. (Fog/View Distance is placed here because the EnvSetMapAppearance2 packet would be too big to include such a versatile feature.)
:'''Client Behavior''': Client must be able to receive '''''EnvSetWeatherType2''''' packets at any time and apply the changes defined in the packet immediately. If an undefined value is used in the ''WeatherType'' or ''WeatherStrength'' fields, the client should ignore that value. If a negative value is given in the ''MaxFog'' field, the client should set that value to its own default. The client should make smooth changes between different strengths of weather and fog distances.
:'''Server Behavior''': Server may send '''''EnvSetWeatherType2''''' packets to successfully connected clients at any time.

===MessageTypes v2===
:Proposed by Cheesse
:This extension adds new ways of presenting information to the player.
:'''Motivation''': To allow the server to send messages in different places and for limited times.
:'''Client Behavior''': Client must interpret the ''PlayerID'' field of the standard [[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|'''''Message''''']] packet as the ''Message Type'' field. Certain values in this field correspond to different locations for messages on the screen. Any undefined values in this field should be ignored and presented as regular chat messages. Without mutual server-client support for this extension, this field should be ignored.
:'''Server Behavior''': Server may use the ''PlayerID'' field of the [[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|'''''Message''''']] packet to have that message placed at a certain location on the player's screen.

===ExtMapInfo===
:Proposed by Cheesse
:This extension allows the server to send the client some of the map's metadata and other information
:'''Motivation''': To allow clients to save metadata with the maps they choose to save. This extension can also be modified to add more features to maps.
:'''Client Behavior''': Client must be able to receive '''''FinalMapInfo''''' packets at any time after a '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|LevelInitialize]]''''' packet has been received and before a '''''FinalMapInfo''''' packet has been received. Client should store the values in these fields in memory to be used later. The metadata defined in these fields come from those defined in the ClassicWorld file definitions. Client should ignore any '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|LevelFinalize]]''''' packets recieved.
:'''Server Behavior''': Server must send '''''FinalMapInfo''''' packets with the correct values after it has finished sending the client the raw block data after sending a '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|LevelInitialize]]''''' packet. The server should not send this packet at any other time. The server should never send any '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|LevelFinalize]]''''' packets to the client.

===BlockDefinitionsExt2===
:Proposed by Goodly.
:This extension allows servers to define more properties for the custom blocks provided by BlockDefinitions.
:'''Motivation''': To allow for better custom blocks to be created.
:'''Client Behavior''': This extension depends on [[Classic_Protocol_Extension#BlockDefinitions|BlockDefinitions extension]] and [[Classic_Protocol_Extension#BlockDefinitionsExt|BlockDefinitionsExt extension]], and must only be enabled if BOTH extensions are mutually supported. Client should be able receive any number of '''''DefineBlockExt2''''' packets during the level loading process (after receiving '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|LevelInitialize]]''''' and until receiving '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|LevelFinalize]]''''' packets). However, dependent on client, this can be sent after level loading (Some clients might just find it more extensible than others).
:Client must be able to accept and render blocks as specified in '''''DefineBlockExt2''''' packets. Clients must accept any valid definitions with ''BlockID'' between 1 and 254, inclusive. If a new definition is accepted for an already-defined ''BlockID'', the old definition should be replaced.
