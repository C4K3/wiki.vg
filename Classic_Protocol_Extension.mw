'''Classic Protocol Extension''' (CPE) is a project to augment the Minecraft Classic network protocol with new and improved functionality.

Extensions are designed to keep extended clients and servers compatible with standard clients and servers. Standard clients and extended clients can play on the same server side-by-side. Extensions are designed to be modular: custom clients and servers can selectively implement any subset of extensions, and only mutually-supported extensions will be used.

==Negotiation==
When CPE-capable client connects to a CPE-capable server, a brief negotiation needs to happen before any extensions are used. Client and server declare their capabilities and determine which extensions are mutually supported. '''All CPE-capable software is required to support this.'''

[[File:CPE_Negotiation.png|frame|right]]
'''Client behavior''': Extended clients must use magic number of <code>0x42</code> (<code>66</code> decimal) for the padding byte of the [[Classic_Protocol#Client_.E2.86.92_Server_packets|'''''ClientIdentification''''']] packet. It must then await a response. If server responds with any packet other than '''''ExtInfo''''', client must assume that the server does NOT support CPE. If the server responds with an '''''ExtInfo''''' packet, client must parse it and any '''''ExtEntry''''' packets that follow. Client must then compare its locally-supported set of extensions with the list of extensions provided by the server, and find an intersection of these sets. These are the mutually-supported extensions. Client must now send '''''ExtInfo''''' packet of its own, followed by a list of zero or more client-supported extensions. After sending the last of '''''ExtEntry''''' packets, client should activate all mutually-supported extensions and resume normal login procedure.

'''Server behavior''': When a client connects, server must read the [[Classic_Protocol#Client_.E2.86.92_Server_packets|'''''ClientIdentification''''']] packet and check its padding byte. If this byte is set to <code>0x42</code> (<code>66</code> decimal), assume that the client supports CPE. If this byte is set to any other value, assume that the client does NOT support CPE.

Server must immediately reply to CPE clients with an '''''ExtInfo''''' packet, followed by zero or more '''''ExtEntry''''' packets, and await a response from the client. Client will respond with one '''''ExtInfo''''' and zero or more '''''ExtEntry''''' packets. Server must then compare its locally-supported set of extensions with the list of extensions provided by the client, and find an intersection of these sets. These are the mutually-supported extensions. After receiving the last of '''''ExtEntry''''' packets, server should activate all mutually-supported extensions and resume normal login procedure. 

'''Note 1''': All standard/non-extended clients use <code>0x00</code> for the padding byte. All standard servers ignore this padding byte. Therefore, this negotiation process does not affect compatibility with standard software.

'''Note 2''': Do not make any assumptions about supported functionality based on the ''AppName'' field of '''''ExtInfo''''' packet. It's for logging purposes only.

'''Note 3''': Do not declare support for an extension until it is FULLY implemented, except for debugging.

|}

===ClickDistance===
:Used to extend or restrict the distance at which client may click blocks, controlled by the server. Click range is given in player-space units (32 units per block). In Minecraft Classic, the default range is 160.
:'''Motivation''': This extension allows trusted players to have a wider or virtually-unlimited reach. It may simplify operation of certain bots. Restricting the reach may allow new games/mini-games.
:'''Client Behavior''': Upon receiving a '''''SetClickDistance''''' packet, client should immediately apply the change. ''Distance'' should persist between worlds/maps.
:'''Server Behavior''': Server should send '''''SetClickDistance''''' packet when the server connects, or whenever their permitted click distance changes. Server should allow for some margin-of-error (+/- 1 block) when enforcing click distance restrictions.

|}

===CustomBlocks===
:Used to add support for custom block types. Custom block IDs start at 50 (0x32). New block types will be added in batches, a few at a time. Both client and server declare which batch they support, and use the lower of the two versions. Claiming to support a batch implies fully implementing all the batches that came before it. If either server or client do not support this extension, only the standard 50 block types should be used.
:'''Motivation''': Adding new visually distinct blocks, to enhance Classic players' experience.
:'''Client behavior''': Client must expect a '''''CustomBlockSupportLevel''''' packet from a compatible server immediately after sending the last '''''ExtEntry''''' packet. It should then reply with its own '''''CustomBlockSupportLevel''''' packet, containing its actual support level. Client must then use the lower of the two levels in operation. Client must not send any block types that are not defined by the current support level. Client should expect [[Classic_Protocol#Client_.E2.86.92_Server_packets|'''''ServerIdentification''''']] packet only AFTER sending its '''''CustomBlockSupportLevel''''' packet.
:'''Server behavior''': Server must send a '''''CustomBlockSupportLevel''''' packet to compatible clients immediately after receiving the last '''''ExtEntry''''' packet from the client. It should then wait to receive a '''''CustomBlockSupportLevel''''' packet from the client before sending the [[Classic_Protocol#Client_.E2.86.92_Server_packets|'''''ServerIdentification''''']] packet. Server must then use the lower of the two levels in operation. If this level is lower than the server's, it has to filter data sent to the client, to make sure that the client never receives any block types that it does not support. Each level will define what substitutions to use.

:Block IDs for future support levels are guaranteed to be assigned monotonically, incrementally, and permanently.

===HeldBlock===
:Provides a way for the client to notify the server about the blocktype that it is currently holding, and for the server to change the currently-held block type.   
:'''Motivation''': This allows server to know which block player is holding, for example for drawing commands, without needing to wait for the player's click. It also allows for features like [http://www.fcraft.net/wiki//Spectate /Spectate] to show what block a spectated player is holding.
:'''Client behavior''': When this extension is mutually supported, client should use the ''PlayerID'' field of the '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Client_.E2.86.92_Server_packets|PositionAndOrientation]]''''' packet (currently unused) to indicate which blocktype the client is currently holding. It should be ready to accept '''''HoldThis''''' packets to change the block that the player is holding. If <code>0</code> is given for ''BlockToHold'', client should hide the hand/block from the screen, and should not be able to click blocks, until they switch to a different blocktype. If an unrecognized blocktype is given, no action is needed.
:'''Server behavior''': The server can use '''''HoldThis''''' packet to force the client to hold the desired block type. It should be done sparingly.

===EmoteFix===
:This extension indicates that the client can render [http://fcraft.net/wiki/Emotes emotes] (ASCII control characters) in chat properly, without padding or suffixes that are required for vanilla client. This extension does not define any new packets.
:'''Motivation''': To improve appearance of emotes in chat.
:'''Client behavior''': Client should not emulate vanilla client's quirks.
:'''Server behavior''': Server should not pad or suffix emotes in chat.

===TextHotKey===
:This extension allows the server to define "hotkeys" for certain commands.
:'''Motivation''': To speed up and simplify access to commonly-used commands and command macros by providing server-defined client-side hotkeys.
:'''Client behavior:''' Client should not try to persist previously-defined hotkeys between sessions. When a defined hotkey is activated by the user, client should open up a text prompt and type in contents of the ''Action'' field. A newline character (<code>\n</code>) in the ''Action'' field indicates that whatever is currently typed-in should be sent to the server. If ''Action'' does not end with a newline, text prompt should be left open, for the user to complete. Client may provide a way for the user to see a list of currently-defined hotkeys, and a way to notify the user when a hotkey was activated.
:'''Server behavior:''' The server should send a definition of each hotkey ('''''SetTextHotKey''''' packet) once per connection.

===ExtPlayerList===
:'''Motivation''': Provides more flexibility in naming of players and loading of skins, autocompletion, and player tab-list display. Separates tracking of in-game entities (spawned player models) and names on the player list. '''''ExtAddPlayerName'''''/'''''ExtRemovePlayerName''''' packets take over managing the player names list (tab-list), and '''''ExtAddEntity2'''''/'''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|DespawnPlayer]]''''' packets are used only to manage in-game entities.

====Version 1 (Deprecated since 28 August 2014)====
:This version of the extension has been deprecated and replaced with version 2. See [[Classic Protocol Extension/Old Extensions|old extensions subpage]].

====Version 2====
Version 2 of this extension replaces '''''ExtAddEntity''''' packet with '''''ExtAddEntity2''''', allows using full URLs for ''SkinName'', and clarifies interaction with [[#ChangeModel|'''ChangeModel''']] extension.
:<h5>Client Behavior</h5>
:When '''''ExtAddPlayerName''''' packet is received for an unrecognized ''NameID'', a new name must be added to the player-name list. When receiving '''''ExtAddPlayerName''''' packet for an already-listed ''NameID'', client must update its ''ListName'', ''GroupName'', and ''GroupRank''. Player-name list must persist when client changes worlds/maps.

:When an '''''ExtAddEntity2''''' packet is received, it must be treated as the '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|SpawnPlayer]]''''' packet. A player model must be spawned in-game at the given location, with ''InGameName'' text drawn above it. Skin should be loaded using the given ''SkinName'' for a player name. When client receives '''''ExtAddEntity2''''' packet for an already-spawned player, a duplicate entity must not be spawned and existing entity's position must not be changed. Instead their ''InGameName'' and ''SkinName'' must be updated. If a negative ''EntityID'' is given for '''''ExtAddEntity2''''', client must update player's own spawn point, ''InGameName'', and ''SkinName''. The client must ignore regular '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|SpawnPlayer]]''''' packets, if any are received.

:Player entity's skin should be loaded using the given ''SkinName''. If ''SkinName'' appears to be a player name, skin should be downloaded from the default skin server. If ''SkinName'' appears to be a full URL to a PNG image (starts with <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code> and ends with <code>.png</code>) then skin should be downloaded from that URL. If image is correctly sized/proportioned to use as a skin for the current model, it should be used. If a blank or unrecognized value is given for ''SkinName'', or if given image could not be downloaded or used, then the default skin should be used.

:Names on the player-name list should be grouped by ''GroupName'' in the player-name list. Names within a ''GroupName'' should be sorted by ''GroupRank'' (in ascending order). Names with the same ''GroupName'' and ''GroupRank'' should be sorted alphabetically by ''ListName''. Color codes may be either drawn or stripped from ''ListName'', ''GroupName'', and ''InGameName''.

:When a standard '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|DespawnPlayer]]''''' packet is received for a recognized ''EntityID'', player model must be removed from a world. When '''''ExtRemovePlayerName''''' packet is received for a recognized ''NameID'', their name must be removed from player-name list. Packets with out-of-range or unrecognized ''NameID''s must be ignored.

:In-game entities must never be affected by '''''ExtAddPlayerName''''' or '''''ExtRemovePlayerName''''' packets. Player name list must never be affected by '''''ExtAddEntity2''''' or '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|DespawnPlayer]]''''' packets.

:Unique ''NameID'' between 0 and 255 should be assigned to every online player. When a new player connects to the server, '''''ExtAddPlayerName''''' must be sent. ''GroupName'' and ''GroupRank'' can be used in any way, for example to group players by map/world or rank/class/faction. Server must use '''''ExtAddEntity2''''' in place of standard '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|SpawnPlayer]]''''' packet. Server should re-send '''''ExtAddPlayerName''''' packet, using the identical ''NameID'', when player's ''ListName'', ''GroupName'', or ''GroupRank'' change. Server must reliably send an '''''ExtRemovePlayerName''''' packet when the player disconnects. Color codes are permitted in ''ListName'', ''GroupName'', and ''InGameName''.

===EnvColors===
:This extension allows server to alter some of the colors used by the client in environment rendering.
:'''Motivation''': To allow the server to give worlds/maps a unique feel: time-of-day, weather/climate, lighting effect, etc.
:'''Client behavior''': Client must check for '''''EnvSetColor''''' packets right before '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|LevelFinalize]]''''' packet, and apply these changes before the map is displayed. Client must be able to read this packet at other times, but it is not required to then apply the changes immediately. If an unrecognized or unsupported ''Variable'' field is given, no action is needed. If an out-of-range color is given by the server (i.e. if any of ''Red'', ''Green'', or ''Blue'' is less than <code>0</code> or greater than <code>255</code>), then the specified ''Variable'' should be reset to its default value.
:'''Server behavior''': Server should normally only use '''''EnvSetColor''''' packets right before the '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|LevelFinalize]]''''' packet. To reset a variable to its default value, the server should send a packet with value <code>-1</code> for ''Red'', ''Green'', and ''Blue''.

===SelectionCuboid===
:'''Motivation''': Allows the server to highlight parts of a world. Applications include zoning, previewing draw commands, previewing undo commands.
:'''Coordinates''': {''StartX'',''StartY'',''StartZ''} are coordinates of the block inside the selection that is closest to the map origin. {''EndX'',''EndY'',''EndZ''} are coordinates of the block inside the selection that is furthest from the map origin. Therefore, the resulting selection has dimensions {''EndX''-''StartX''+1, ''EndY''-''StartY''+1, ''EndZ''-''StartZ''+1).
:'''Client behavior''': Client should be ready to receive '''''MakeSelection''''' packets any time after '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|LevelFinalize]]''''' packet. Upon receiving the packet, a translucent cuboid should appear in the world. The cuboid may feature a plain or "grid" texture. Selections that extend outside the map may be either ignored or clipped to fit. Selections with inconsistent coordinates (e.g. where ''StartX''<''EndX'') may either be ignored or re-ordered. Out-of-range values for ''Red'', ''Green'', ''Blue'', and ''Opacity'' should be clipped to fit the valid range. Supporting ''Opacity'' is optional: the client may opt to provide fixed opacity instead. When map changes (i.e. when '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|LevelInitialize]]''''' packet is received), all existing selections should be removed. '''''RemoveSelection''''' packets that refer to non-existent ''SelectionID''s should be ignored.
:'''Server behavior''': All given coordinates must be contained within the map. End coordinates should be higher or equal than start coordinates.

===BlockPermissions===
:This extension allows the server to instruct the player that certain block types are allowed/disallowed to be placed or deleted.
:'''Motivation''': To prevent players from inadvertently placing or removing prohibited block types (e.g. water, lava, grass, admincrete), before it even reaches the server.
:'''Client behavior:''' Client should prevent placement of prohibited block types (by graying out or hiding blocks in block-selection screen, or any other effective means). Client should prevent player from deleting prohibited block types. Client must be ready to receive '''''SetBlockPermission''''' packet after map load ('''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|LevelFinalize]]''''' packet). Permission changes should take effect as soon as packet is received. Admincrete (solid block) permissions set by '''''SetBlockPermission''''' must always override permission set by '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|ServerIdentification]]''''' and '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|UpdateUserType]]''''' packets. If ''BlockType'' is set to <code>0</code>, given permissions should affect ALL block types at once, overriding permissions set by any earlier packets. Permissions must persist between map changes. Client may optionally warn the player attempting to place/delete prohibited blocks via sound effect, visual effect, chat message, etc.
:'''Server behavior:''' Server may send '''''SetBlockPermission''''' packets any time after map load ('''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|LevelFinalize]]''''' packet). Any valid block ID may be specified for ''BlockType'', including custom blocks (if [[#CustomBlocks|CustomBlocks extension]] is mutually supported). ''BlockType'' may be set to <code>0</code> to set permissions for ALL block types at once. Server must not assume that client is compliant/obedient, and server must still verify each '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|SetBlock]]''''' packet coming from the client. What to do with non-complying clients (kick or warn) is up to you.

===ChangeModel===
:Allows changing appearance of player models in supporting clients.
<h5>Client Behavior</h5>
:The client will receive an ''EntityID'' and a string value containing the model name. The client will then change the model of the player whose ID is the same as the received '''''AddEntity''''', '''''ExtAddEntity''''', or '''''ExtAddEntity2''''' packet. The model name will be parsed by the model manager and the model changed in game. If the model does not exists in the model manager or is 0-length, change the model back to humanoid. Alternatively, you can send the client an int converted to a string which represents a valid Block ID. An ''EntityID'' of -1 (255 unsigned) indicates the player's own model. If model is set to <code>humanoid</code>, player-specific skin should be used. For all other models, default model-specific textures should be used.

<h5>Server Behavior</h5>
:The server may send an ''EntityID'' and then a ''ModelName'' to the client for a desired entity. The model name must be chosen from the list below. To reset the model to default, server should set ''ModelName'' to <code>humanoid</code> or to an empty string.

<h5>Interaction with ExtPlayerList</h5>
:If an '''''ExtAddEntity2''''' packet is received for a non-<code>humanoid</code> entity and ''SkinName'' specifies a full URL, that image should be downloaded and used as a texture for the currently model. Receiving another '''''ExtAddEntity2''''' packet should either update this texture (if ''SkinName'' is a full URL) or reset it back to default (if ''SkinName'' is anything else). Receiving another '''''ChangeModel''''' packet with a non-<code>humanoid</code> ''ModelName'' should reset texture back to model-specific default.

===EnvMapAppearance===
:This extension allows the server to specify custom terrain textures, and tweak appearance of map edges.
:'''Motivation''': To provide more ways to customize map appearance, including functionality that's currently provided by [http://files.worldofminecraft.com/texturing/ World of Minecraft's scheme].
:'''Client behavior:''' Client must be able to receive '''''EnvSetMapAppearance''''' packets any time during level load (after the first '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|LevelDataChunk]]''''' packet is received and until the '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|LevelFinalize]]''''' packet is received). If the ''TextureURL'' field is blank or if the given file could not be loaded for any reason, then the texture pack should be reset to client's default. If an unsupported block ID is given for ''SideBlock'' or ''EdgeBlock'', it should be ignored. Given ''SideLevel'' value should be adjusted to fit between <code>0</code> and <code>MapDepth</code>, if necessary. Client should keep using these appearance parameters for future maps, unless specified otherwise by the server.
:'''Server behavior:''' Server may send '''''EnvSetMapAppearance''''' packets after the last '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|LevelDataChunk]]''''' packet is sent for a level. Server should not use any custom block IDs unless the client declared the appropriate [[#CustomBlocks|CustomBlocks]] support level. To reset the texture pack to default value, server should send an '''''EnvMapAppearance''''' packet with empty string for ''TextureURL''. To reset other fields, server should simply use the default values (listed below).
:'''Block type restrictions:''' Only solid blocks are allowed to be used for ''SideBlock'' and ''EdgeBlock''. Sprites (Sapling, Dandelion, Rose, BrownMushroom, RedMushroom, Rope, Fire) partial-height blocks (Slab, CobblestoneSlab, Snow), and transparent blocks (Air, Leaves, Glass) cannot be used for those fields.

===EnvWeatherType===
:This extension allows the server to trigger special weather conditions (like rain and snow) on demand.

:'''Client behavior''': Client must be able to receive '''''EnvWeather''''' packets at any time after the first '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|LevelDataChunk]]''''' packet is received, and apply these changes immediately. If an unrecognized or unsupported ''WeatherType'' field is given, no action is needed.
:'''Server behavior''': Server may send '''''EnvSetColor''''' packets to connected clients at any time after the first '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|LevelDataChunk]]''''' packet is sent.

===HackControl===
:This extension allows the server to control cheats/hacks in the client.
:'''Motivation''': To allow fine-grained control over cheats/hacks on multi-world servers.
:'''Client behavior''': Client must be able to receive '''''HackControl''''' packets at any time after the first '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|LevelDataChunk]]''''' packet is received, and apply these changes immediately. Unrecognized or unsupported values for any field should be ignored. Clients may approximate ''JumpHeight'' by rounding down to the nearest half-block (i.e. nearest multiple of 16), if needed. If a negative value is given for ''JumpHeight'', client should reset jump height to its default setting (around <code>40</code> in vanilla Minecraft).
:'''Server behavior''': Server may send '''''HackControl''''' packets to connected clients at any time after the first '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|LevelDataChunk]]''''' packet is sent.

===MessageTypes===
[[Image:Messagetypes.PNG|right|700px|Examples of all possible MessageTypes.]]
:This extension adds new ways of presenting messages in the client.
:'''Motivation''': To enhance the display of announcements and status information, and to reduce chat clutter.
:'''Client behavior''': When this extension is mutually supported, the ''PlayerID'' field of the standard server-to-client [[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|'''''Message''''']] packet should be treated as a ''MessageType'' code. Unrecognized or unsupported codes may be ignored (in which case the message should be presented as a regular chat message). When connected to non-supporting servers, this field should be ignored.
:'''Server behavior''': Server may use the ''PlayerID'' field of the [[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|'''''Message''''']] packet to set a ''MessageType''. For non-supporting clients, this field should always be set to <code>0</code>.

:This extension does not define any new packets.

===PlayerClick===
:This extension lets the server receive details of every mouse click a player makes, including targeting information.
:'''Motivation''': To allow for the creation of more interactive maps: interactive buttons, cannons, ability to "tag" or "shoot" other players, ability to drag-to-draw at a distance, etc.
:'''Client Behavior''': When this extension is mutually supported, a '''''PlayerClicked''''' packet should be sent to the server, as soon as reasonably possible, every time the user presses or releases a mouse button. Mouse interactions that happen while player is interacting with chat, with GUI menus, or with any other application must NOT be sent. A matching "released" event must be sent for every "pressed" event.

:High resolution up-to-date ''Yaw'' and ''Pitch'' for the player should be transmitted with every packet. If player is currently targeting another entity/player ''TargetEntityID'' fields should be set. If player is currently targeting a block (within permitted [[Classic_Protocol_Extension#ClickDistance|ClickDistance]]) ''TargetBlockX'', ''TargetBlockY'', ''TargetBlockZ'', and ''TargetBlockFace'' should be set. An out-of-range value should be used for these fields when they are not in use. These packets should not be sent during level transitions (after receiving '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|LevelInitialize]]''''' and until receiving '''''[[Classic_Protocol#Server_.E2.86.92_Client_packets|LevelFinalize]]''''' packets).
:'''Server Behavior''': Server must be ready to accept any number of '''''PlayerClicked''''' packets at any time after level sending has completed. What to do with this information is entirely up to the server.
