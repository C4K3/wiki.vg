'''Server List Ping''' ('''SLP''') is an interface provided by Minecraft servers which supports querying the MOTD, player count, max players and server version via the usual port. SLP is part of the [[Protocol]], so unlike [[Query]], the interface is always enabled. The Notchian client uses this interface to display the multiplayer server list, hence the name. The SLP process changed in {{Minecraft Wiki|1.7}} in a non-backwards compatible way, but current servers still support both the [[#Current|new]] and [[#1.6|old]] process.

== Current ==

This uses the regular client-server [[protocol]]. For the general packet format, see that article.

=== Handshake ===

First, the client sends a [[Protocol#Handshake|Handshake]] packet with its state set to 1.

=== Request ===

The client follows up with a [[Protocol#Request|Request]] packet. This packet has no fields.

=== Response ===

The server should respond with a [[Protocol#Response|Response]] packet. Note that Notchian servers will for unknown reasons wait to receive the following [[Protocol#Ping|Ping]] packet for 30 seconds before timing out and sending Response.

 | JSON Response
 | String
 | see below
 |}

The JSON Response field is a [[wikipedia:JSON|JSON]] object which has the following format:

<syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
{
    "version": {
        "name": "1.8.7",
        "protocol": 47
    },
    "players": {
        "max": 100,
        "online": 5,
        "sample": [
            {
                "name": "thinkofdeath",
                "id": "4566e69f-c907-48ee-8d71-d7ba5aa00d20"
            }
        ]
    },	
    "description": {
        "text": "Hello world"
    },
    "favicon": "data:image/png;base64,<data>"
}
</syntaxhighlight>

The ''description'' field is a [[Chat]] object.  Note that the Notchian server has no way of providing actual chat component data; instead section sign-based codes are embedded within the text of text of the object.

The ''sample'' and ''favicon'' fields are optional.

The ''favicon'' should be a [[wikipedia:Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] image that is [[wikipedia:Base64|Base64]] encoded and prepended with <code>data:image/png;base64,</code>.

After receiving the Response packet, the client may send the next packet to help calculate the server's latency, or if it is only interested in the above information it can disconnect here.

If the client does not receive a properly formatted response, then it will instead attempt a [[Server_List_Ping#1.6|legacy ping]].

=== Ping ===

If the process is continued, the client will now send a [[Protocol#Ping|Ping]] packet containing some payload which is not important.

=== Pong ===

The server will respond with the [[Protocol#Pong|Pong]] packet and then close the connection.

== 1.6 ==

This uses a protocol which is compatible with the client-server protocol as it was before the Netty rewrite. Modern servers recognize this protocol by the starting byte of <code>fe</code> instead of the usual <code>00</code>.

=== Client to server ===

The client initiates a TCP connection to the server on the standard port. Instead of doing auth and logging in (as detailed in [[Protocol]] and [[Protocol Encryption]]), it sends the following data, expressed in hexadecimal:

# <code>FE</code> — packet identifier for a server list ping
# <code>01</code> — server list ping's payload (always 1)
# <code>FA</code> — packet identifier for a plugin message
# <code>00 0B</code> — length of following string, in characters, as a short (always 11)
# <code>00 4D 00 43 00 7C 00 50 00 69 00 6E 00 67 00 48 00 6F 00 73 00 74</code> — the string <code>MC|PingHost</code> encoded as a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16 UTF-16BE] string
# <code>XX XX</code> — length of the rest of the data, as a short. Compute as <code>7 + len(hostname)</code>, where <code>len(hostname)</code> is the number of bytes in the UTF-16BE encoded hostname.
# <code>XX</code> — [[Protocol version numbers#Versions before the Netty rewrite|protocol version]], e.g. <code>4a</code> for the last version (74)
# <code>XX XX</code> — length of following string, in characters, as a short
# <code>...</code> — hostname the client is connecting to, encoded as a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16 UTF-16BE] string
# <code>XX XX XX XX</code> — port the client is connecting to, as an int.

All data types are big-endian.

Example packet dump:

 0000000: fe01 fa00 0b00 4d00 4300 7c00 5000 6900  ......M.C.|.P.i.
 0000010: 6e00 6700 4800 6f00 7300 7400 1949 0009  n.g.H.o.s.t..I..
 0000020: 006c 006f 0063 0061 006c 0068 006f 0073  .l.o.c.a.l.h.o.s
 0000030: 0074 0000 63dd                           .t..c.

=== Server to client ===

The server responds with a 0xFF kick packet. The packet begins with a single byte identifier <code>ff</code>, then a two-byte big endian short giving the length of the following string in characters. You can actually ignore the length because the server closes the connection after the response is sent.

After the first 3 bytes, the packet is a UTF-16BE string. It begins with two characters: <code>§1</code>, followed by a null character. On the wire these look like <code>00 a7 00 31 00 00</code>.

The remainder is null character (that is <code>00 00</code>) delimited fields:

# Protocol version (e.g. <code>74</code>)
# Minecraft server version (e.g. <code>1.8.7</code>)
# Message of the day (e.g. <code>A Minecraft Server</code>)
# Current player count
# Max players

The entire packet looks something like this:

                 <---> first character
 0000000: ff00 2300 a700 3100 0000 3400 3700 0000  ....§.1...4.7...
 0000010: 3100 2e00 3400 2e00 3200 0000 4100 2000  1...4...2...A. .
 0000020: 4d00 6900 6e00 6500 6300 7200 6100 6600  M.i.n.e.c.r.a.f.
 0000030: 7400 2000 5300 6500 7200 7600 6500 7200  t. .S.e.r.v.e.r.
 0000040: 0000 3000 0000 3200 30                   ..0...2.0

== 1.4 to 1.5 ==

Prior to the Minecraft 1.6, the client to server operation is much simpler, and only sends <code>FE 01</code>, with none of the following data.

=== Examples ===

* [https://gist.github.com/5795159 PHP]
* [https://gist.github.com/4574114 Java]
* [https://gist.github.com/6223787 C#]

== Beta 1.8 to 1.3 ==

Prior to Minecraft 1.4, the client only sends <code>FE</code>. 

Additionally, the response from the server only contains 3 fields delimited by <code>§</code>:

# Message of the day (e.g. <code>A Minecraft Server</code>)
# Current player count
# Max players

The entire packet looks something like this:

                 <---> first character
 0000000: ff00 1700 4100 2000 4d00 6900 6e00 6500  ....A. .M.i.n.e.
 0000010: 6300 7200 6100 6600 7400 2000 5300 6500  c.r.a.f.t. .S.e.
 0000020: 7200 7600 6500 7200 a700 3000 a700 3100  r.v.e.r.§.0.§.1.
 0000030: 30                                       0
