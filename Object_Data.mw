This article documents the '''Data''' field in the [[Protocol#Spawn Object|Spawn Object]] packet. The field is of type Int, and the meaning of its contents depend on the [[Entities#Objects|type of object]] being spawned, as defined in the Type field of the same packet, and is documented below.

In some cases, the data field has no meaning, but is only used to indicate presence of velocity.  In others, it (and velocity) is always ignored.

== Item (id 2) ==

The int value is ignored, but should be set to <code>1</code> to indicate that velocity is present.

== Minecarts (id 10) ==

The int value itself specifies the minecart's functionality:
