Alpha worlds consist of several files, all held together in one folder under a very rigid directory structure.

= Level =

The level is a file called "level.dat" in the root of the world.

{| class="wikitable"
! Name || Type || Description
|-
| Data || Compound || General level data
{| class="wikitable"
! Name || Type || Description
|-
| RandomSeed || Long || The seed of the world, which is used to generate new geometry.
|-
| SpawnX || Int || The X coordinate of the default spawn point
|-
| SpawnY || Int || The Y coordinate of the default spawn point
|-
| SpawnZ || Int || The Z coordinate of the default spawn point
|}
|}


= Chunks =

Chunks are stored in folders inside the world corresponding to their coordinates in base-36. The path is "<base-36-x-63>/<base-36-z-63>/c.<base-36-x>.<base-36-z>.dat", where <base-36-x-63> is the base-36 representation of the X coordinate of the chunk AND'd bitwise with 63.

For example, if we have the chunk coordinate (39, -13), we end up with the path 13/1f/c.13.-d.dat

The main world is stored in the root directory of the world. The Nether is stored in the "DIM-1" folder in the root and uses the same chunk folder system.

== The Base-36 Algorithm ==

To retrieve the base-36 representation of a number, use the digits "0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", and prefix the result with a hyphen ("-") if the number is negative.

Example code in Python, from [[Beta]]:

 def base36(i):
     """
     Return the string representation of i in base 36, using lowercase letters.
     """
     letters = "0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
     if i < 0:
         i = -i
         signed = True
     elif i == 0:
         return "0"
     else:
         signed = False
     s = ""
     while i:
         i, digit = divmod(i, 36)
         s = letters[digit] + s
     if signed:
         s = "-" + s
     return s

Example code in C#:


<source lang=csharp>
public static string Base36Encode(long input)
{
	if (input == 0){ return "0"; }
	string chars = "0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
	bool negative = (input < 0);

	StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

	if (negative) {
		input = -input;
		sb.Append("-");
	}
	while (input > 0) {
		sb.Insert((negative ? 1 : 0), chars[(int)(input % 36)]);
		input /= 36;
	}
	return sb.ToString();
}
</source>

= Players =

Persistent data for players is stored in a folder called "players". Each player has a file called "<username>.dat".

{| class="wikitable"
! Name || Type || Description
|-
| Pos || List of 3 doubles || X, Y, and Z coordinates of the player position, in pixel coordinates
|-
| Rotation || List of 2 doubles || Yaw and pitch of the player, in degrees
|}

= Map Generation =

There are several approaches to map generation.

== Noise ==

Two-dimensional noise functions can be used to provide a terrain height at certain coordinates.
