As of 12w17a, minecraft implements SSL-like encryption.

== Overview ==

#Client connects to server
#'''C->S''' 0x02 handshake
#'''S->C''' 0xFD encryption request - server sends its public key
#Client generates symmetric key (shared secret)
#Client authenticates via session.minecraft.net
#'''C->S''' 0xFC encryption response - client encrypts shared secret with server's public key and sends
#Server decrypts shared secret with its private key
#Server checks player authenticity via session.minecraft.net
#'''S->C''' 0xFC encryption response - empty payload
#Server enables RC4 stream encryption
#Client enables RC4 stream encryption
#'''C->S''' 0x01 login
#'''S->C''' 0x01 login

For a Code example you can have a look at this example of a Chat Bot using a C# Protocol Library: 
https://minecraftprotocol.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/68979#1204175

== Key Exchange ==

The server generates a 1024-bit RSA keypair on startup. The key, when packed into a 0xFD packet, is in ASN.1 format as defined by x.509.
The ASN.1 structure looks as follows

 SubjectPublicKeyInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
   algorithm SEQUENCE {
     algorithm         OBJECT IDENTIFIER
     parameters        ANY OPTIONAL
   }
   subjectPublicKey  BITSTRING
 }
 
 SubjectPublicKey ::= SEQUENCE {
   modulus           INTEGER
   publicExponent    INTEGER
 }

If you're struggling to import this using a crypto library, you can convert it to common PEM by base64-encoding and wrapping in '-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----' and '-----END PUBLIC KEY-----'.

== Symmetric Encryption ==

12w18a:

On receipt of a 0xFD from the server, the client will generate a 16-byte shared secret, to be used with the RC4 stream cipher. It then encrypts it with the server's public key (PKCS#1 padded), and sends it to the server with a 0xFC.

The server decrypts the shared secret using its private key. It then sends a 0xFC to the client with an empty payload, and enables RC4 encryption. Similarly, the client will also enable encryption upon receipt of the empty 0xFC. From this point forward, everything is encrypted.

12w19a:

On receipt of a 0xFD from the server, the client will generate a 32-byte shared secret, to be used with the HC-256 stream cipher. It then encrypts it with the server's public key (PKCS#1 padded), and sends it to the server with a 0xFC.

The server decrypts the shared secret using its private key. It then sends a 0xFC to the client with an empty payload, and enables HC-256 encryption. For the Initial Vector (IV) Both sides use the first 16 byte of the key. Similarly, the client will also enable encryption upon receipt of the empty 0xFC. From this point forward, everything is encrypted.

== Authentication ==

Both server and client need to make a request to session.minecraft.net if the server is in online-mode.

=== Client ===

After generating the shared secret, the client generates the following hash:

 sha1 := Sha1()
 sha1.update(serverId from 0xFC) 
 sha1.update(shared secret) 
 sha1.update(server's encoded public key from 0xFC) 
 hash := sha1.hexdigest()  # String of hex characters

[[File:Icon_exclaim.gif|:!:]] Note that the Sha1.hexdigest() method used by minecraft removes leading zeros and uses the two's-complement of negative numbers prefixed with a minus sign:

 sha1(Notch) :  4ed1f46bbe04bc756bcb17c0c7ce3e4632f06a48
 sha1(jeb_)  : -7c9d5b0044c130109a5d7b5fb5c317c02b4e28c1
 sha1(simon) :  88e16a1019277b15d58faf0541e11910eb756f6

The resulting hash is then sent via an HTTP GET request to
 <nowiki>http://session.minecraft.net/game/joinserver.jsp?user=</nowiki>''username''&sessionId=''[[Session#Login|user_session]]''&serverId=''hash''
If it returns '''OK''' then continue, otherwise stop

=== Server ===

After decrypting the shared secret in 0xFD, the sever generates the login hash as above and sends it to
 <nowiki>http://session.minecraft.net/game/checkserver.jsp?user=</nowiki>''username''&serverId=''hash''

If the response is '''YES''' then the client is authenticated and allowed to join. Otherwise the client will/should be [[Protocol#Disconnect.2FKick_.280xFF.29|kicked]] (unencrypted) with "Failed to verify username!"
