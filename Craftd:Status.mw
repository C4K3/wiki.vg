craftd is on [https://github.com/kev009/craftd/ github]. This is a developer preview for feedback. It doesn't currently implement much of the Minecraft protocol, but you can follow along and track progress. Check back later for release tarballs and eventually binaries.

== Things that have been hashed out: ==
*Autotools build system for cross-platform ease & possible distro inclusion
*libevent2 cross-platform event polling and network I/O
*Fast packet state machine and variable length packet decoder
*Pthreads worker pool
*libevent2 integrated httpd
*Daemon basics -- need conventional SIG handlers, SIGHUP, pid locks
*Choose a FOSS license -> Simplified BSD
*Logging. XSI/Single UNIX Specification syslog most likely. -> syslog with alternative stdout selector at runtime.
*Configuration files -> JSON formatted
*Chat, motd, string handling (bstring)
*Basic NBT read and write support
*Chunk sending

== Future directions/TODO: ==
These are future research and development ideas in arbitrary order.
*World file format. custom w/import-export? BerkeleyDB?
*Sparse matrix for ^?
*Binaries for Linux, Win32(MinGW), FreeBSD
*Stress test w/large num users - Goal 100+ simultaneous
*Dynamically tunable worker pool
*Use more zero copy I/O
*JSON-REST admin/status API
*Security audit - perpetual
*Running from a chroot
*Native WIN32 threading with MinGW - needs a contributor/maintainer
*Protocol testing framework
*IPC to an IRC relay agent
*Alternative/improved protocol for NPCs, bots, scripting?
