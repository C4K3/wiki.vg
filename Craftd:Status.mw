== Status ==
craftd is on [https://github.com/kev009/craftd/ github]. This is a developer preview for feedback. It doesn't currently implement much of the Minecraft protocol, but you can follow along and track progress. Check back later for release tarballs and eventually binaries.

== Roadmap ==

=== 0.3 - Future (May change) ===
GOAL: Stable core and operation with 100 player over 24 hours

* Complex world modifications
** Implement simple World Block Actions
*** Grass Spread
*** Fire Spread
*** Water/Lava Spread
** Fix Implementation of Time
** Implement Lighting Engine
** Implement Block Identifiers (Wood, Stone, etc)
* Basic Mobs
** Implement Pigs
** Implement Cows
** Implement Sheep
** Implement mutant duck/bird thing we call Chickens
* Correctly Implement Creative Mode

=== 0.2 - In Progress ===
'''Experimental Branch can be found [https://github.com/HACKhalo2/craftd/tree/experimental here]'''

GOAL: Stable core and operation with 100 players over 30 minutes

* Simple world modifications (digging/placing blocks) ('''In Progress''')
** World saving ('''Currently in Memory''')
*** Implemented Crimity's seemingly faster chunk hashing code ('''Experimental build in progress''')
*** Basic digging ('''Experimental Build Done, needs overview''')
**** Creative Mode ('''Done''')
**** Survival Mode ('''Done''')
*** Basic block placement ('''Experimental Build in progress''')
**** Creative Mode ('''Buggy, but Working''')
**** Survival Mode ('''Same as Above''')
*** Chunk Saving/Loading
* Implement Protocol 17 (MC 1.8.1) Structs
** Update survival plugin to 1.8 specs (currently is 1.4)
** Packets ('''Almost Done, need packet [http://wiki.vg/Protocol#Item_Data_.280x83.29 0x83]''')
*** Check packets against newest protocol for accuracy
** Mobs
** Per-World Dimension and Mode ('''Partially Complete''')
* Improved Error handling
** Catch socket errors

=== 0.1a - Released ===
Experimental release exploring the Minecraft protocol and various libraries.  Basic support for loading worlds and walking around.

=== Unplanned ===
These depend on developer interest and current needs.
* Proxy (dotblank?)- re-implement proxy support to front-end other servers for multi-world, protocol optimization, etc. 
* InfiniCraft - if this isn't dead, implement it some time https://github.com/InfiniCraft/

== Dev stuff ==
=== Things that have been hashed out: ===
*Autotools build system for cross-platform ease & possible distro inclusion
*libevent2 cross-platform event polling and network I/O
*Fast packet state machine and variable length packet decoder
*Pthreads worker pool
*libevent2 integrated httpd
*Daemon basics -- need conventional SIG handlers, SIGHUP, pid locks
*Choose a FOSS license -> Simplified BSD
*Logging. XSI/Single UNIX Specification syslog most likely. -> syslog with alternative stdout selector at runtime.
*Configuration files -> JSON formatted
*Chat, motd, string handling (bstring)
*Basic NBT read and write support
*Chunk sending
*Dynamically tunable worker pool

=== Future directions/TODO: ===
These are future research and development ideas in arbitrary order.
*World file format. custom w/import-export? BerkeleyDB?
*Sparse matrix for ^?
*Binaries for Linux, Win32(MinGW), FreeBSD
*Stress test w/large num users - Goal 100+ simultaneous
*Use more zero copy I/O
*JSON-REST admin/status API
*Security audit - perpetual
*Running from a chroot
*Native WIN32 threading with MinGW - needs a contributor/maintainer
*Protocol testing framework
*IPC to an IRC relay agent
*Alternative/improved protocol for NPCs, bots, scripting?
