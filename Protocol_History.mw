=== 2011-9-29 ===
* <div class="li">Beta 1.9 pre2.</div>
* Protocol version is now 19
* Four packets changed:
** [[Protocol#Player_Block_Placement_.280x0F.29|0x0F player block placement]]
** [[Protocol#Window_click_.280x66.29|0x66 window click]]
** [[Protocol#Set_slot_.280x67.29|0x67 set slot]]
** [[Protocol#Window_items_.280x68.29|0x68 window items]]
* The change affects the "slot" datatype. This type consists of at least a short (item_id). If this id isn't <code>-1</code>, a byte (count) and a short (uses) follow.
* From 1.9pre2 onward, additional data is sent but only for [https://gist.github.com/1268479 certain item_ids]. This means the protocol is no longer context free. The additional data is ''at least'' a short. If this short isn't -1, a byte[] array follows, containing ''gzipped'' NBT data
* The format of the NBT is as follows
<code>
  COMPOUND
    LIST: 'ench'
      SHORT: 'id'
      SHORT: 'lvl'
    END
  END
</code>
* So far only this format, with 'id' and 'lvl' set to <code>2</code> and <code>1</code> respectively, has been seen.
