'''ChunkPS''' (Tentitive Title) is a cloud-based NBT Chunk provider. It's currently being drafted, so things are likely going to change drastically.

ChunkPS is going to be [[craftd:Main_Page|craftd's]] main Chunk provider interface. But this doesn't mean that other servers, like [https://github.com/huin/chunkymonkey Chunky Monkey], [https://github.com/SpaceManiac/Glowstone Glowstone], ect al won't be able to use it. On the contrary, ChunkPS will be designed for anything that deals with the Beta/Release NBT world format.
