This page covers the map information as of 1.2.4.  See [[Alpha Map Format]] for Alpha information.

=General Information=

Maps are represented as a series of regions, within which are a number of columns, and chunks.  Each region is 32x1x32 columns, each column is 1x16x1 chunks, and each chunk is 16x16x16 blocks.  The overall block height of a column is 256.  Each chunk stores four (or five) things - block IDs (8-bit), block metadata (4-bit), block light (4-bit), and sky light (4-bit).  Block light is light cast by things like torches and glowstone, and is calculated with a 3D [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill Flood Fill] algorithm.  Sky light is the light cast by the sky, and is calculated by starting at the top and working your way down.  As you pass through semi-transparent blocks, you decrease the lighting value until you hit an opaque block.  The opaque block is the last block whose skylight has a nonzero value.  Lighting starts at 0xF (brightest) and works down to 0x0 (dimmest).  Map columns store biome information.  Each 1x256x1 cuboid of blocks has the same biome value, for a total of 256 possible biome values per chunk (16x16).
