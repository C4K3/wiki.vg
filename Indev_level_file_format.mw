==Level File Format==
Minecraft levels uses a custom tagged binary format I've chosen to call Named Binary Tag (or NBT for short).<br>
To be able to load and save Minecraft levels in a future proof way, please implement support for NBT.<br>
You can read the specification [[NBT|here]] (includes an example of how to parse the format).

Minecraft level files have the file extension <tt>mclevel</tt>, and Internet media type ("MIME type") <tt>application/x-minecraft-level</tt>

Here's the layout of a minecraft level NBT file:<br>

TAG_Compound "MinecraftLevel"
{
   TAG_Compound "Environment" 
   {
      TAG_Short "SurroundingGroundHeight"// Height of surrounding ground (in blocks)
      TAG_Byte "SurroundingGroundType"   // Block ID of surrounding ground
      TAG_Short "SurroundingWaterHeight" // Height of surrounding water (in blocks)
      TAG_Byte "SurroundingWaterType"    // Block ID of surrounding water
      TAG_Short "CloudHeight"            // Height of the cloud layer (in blocks)
      TAG_Int "CloudColor"               // Hexadecimal value for the color of the clouds
      TAG_Int "SkyColor"                 // Hexadecimal value for the color of the sky
      TAG_Int "FogColor"                 // Hexadecimal value for the color of the fog
      TAG_Byte "SkyBrightness"           // The brightness of the sky, from 0 to 100
   }
   
   TAG_List "Entities"
   {
      TAG_Compound
      {
         // One of these per entity on the map.
         // These can change a lot, and are undocumented.
         // Feel free to play around with them, though.
         // The most interesting one might be the one with ID "LocalPlayer", which contains the player inventory
      }
   }
   
   TAG_Compound "Map"
   {
      // To access a specific block from either byte array, use the following algorithm:
      // Index = x + (y * Depth + z) * Width

      TAG_Short "Width"                  // Width of the level (along X) 
      TAG_Short "Height"                 // Height of the level (along Y) 
      TAG_Short "Length"                 // Length of the level (along Z) 
      TAG_Byte_Array "Blocks"             // An array of Length*Height*Width bytes specifying the block types
      TAG_Byte_Array "Data"              // An array of Length*Height*Width bytes with data for each blocks
      
      TAG_List "Spawn"                   // Default spawn position
      {
         TAG_Short x  // These values are multiplied by 32 before being saved
         TAG_Short y  // That means that the actual values are x/32.0, y/32.0, z/32.0
         TAG_Short z
      }
   }
   
   TAG_Compound "About"
   {
      TAG_String "Name"                  // Level name
      TAG_String "Author"                // Name of the player who made the level
      TAG_Long "CreatedOn"               // Timestamp when the level was first created
   }
}
