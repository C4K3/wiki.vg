Documentation of the [http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2520465 World Downloader mod]'s plugin channel configuration system.

See [https://github.com/Pokechu22/WorldDownloader/blob/master/src/wdl/WDLPluginChannels.java here].

== Note ==

All types here are as specified by Java's [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/DataOutputStream.html <code>DataOutputStream</code>] and can be read using a [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/DataInputStream.html <code>DataInputStream</code>], unless otherwise noted.

== <code>WDL|INIT</code> ==

<code>WDL|INIT</code> is sent to show that World Downloader is ready to receive new permissions.  Don't send permissions until this is received - it may still be saving from another part of the map or another sever where it has permission, and revoking permission in the middle is a Bad Thing&trade;.
