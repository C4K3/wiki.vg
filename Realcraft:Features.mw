== Implemented ==
These features are currently implemented in Realcraft.

* Cross-platform support
* MySQL database support ''(partial completion, see planned features)''
** Player ranks
** Server and world-specific options
** Player position saving/loading
* Chat and command support
* Player ping list (in-game tab window) support (includes user colors and actual pings)
* Entity actions such as sprinting and crouching

== Planned ==
These features have yet to be implemented into Realcraft, but are planned for the future.

* Use libnoise for world generation
* Player authentication using Minecraft.net
* Better entity management
* Sending player spawn messages to other players
** Prerequisite: Fix entity management
* MySQL database support ''(partial completion, see implemented features)''
** Player whitelist and blacklist support ''(MySQL tables are in-place for such features)''
** Server logging
*** Access logs for chests
*** Entry logs for areas, some moderation so they cannot spam the logs by leaving/entering the area repeatedly in a small period
*** Chat and command history
*** Attempted access for blocked chests (i.e. chest owner X banned Y player, Y player tries to access chest)
** Chest/door/area protection ''(MySQL tables are in-place for such features)''
* Anti-cheat system
** Kick player if cheating suspected, note in logs
** No player teleporting (flying, moving fast, etc.) unless generated by server
** No arbitrarily placing blocks/items without checking item in hand first
** Player must be looking at chest/door in order to open/close the object
* Anti-spam in chat
** Kick player if spam detected, note in logs
** Be tolerant of network latency issues causing Minecraft to re-send chat messages
*** Need to see why this actually occurs. If TCP frames are being repeated, this is already fixed by Realbasic's TCPSocket class
* Detection of players entering/leaving areas
** Need to create a caching system that is both fast (will be queued every time someone moves) and is also self-managed by MySQL tables
** Stop movement of players entering areas they're banned from
* More in-game commands
