== Plugins ==

Writing a plugin is pretty simple, you just have to create a loadable object with the 2 following functions:

<syntaxhighlight lang="C">
extern
bool
CD_PluginInitialize (CDPlugin* self)
{
    // Initialize data, register to events, register to timeouts, do whatever is need to initialize your plugin

    // return true if everything went as expected, return false to let the plugin manager know this plugin wasn't loaded correctly
}

extern
bool
CD_PluginFinalize (CDPlugin* self)
{
    // Destroy data, unregister events and stuff

    // Same as for the initialize, return value states if the plugin unloaded correctly
}
</syntaxhighlight>

It's adviced to use the hash in PRIVATE(self) instead of global static variables to keep the data, in this way other plugins
can work with the data of your plugin if they want to.
