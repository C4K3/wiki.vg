This is the (unofficial) protocol docs for Minecraft: PE. The protocol currently uses UDP for communication, different from PC (TCP). The usual UDP issues are still here (lost packets, wrong order, etc.), but the protocol solves a few of those problems using special packet encapsulation, based on TCP. The Minecraft: PE client uses RakNet for it's networking library. Even though it uses RakNet, you can still write software without the library.


== Data Types ==
Minecraft packets use different data types to communicate with each other. The documented ones are listed below:

{| class="wikitable"
|- class="row0"
| class="col0" |
! class="col1" | Size
! class="col2" | Range
! class="col3" | Notes
|- class="row1"
! class="col0 centeralign" | byte
| class="col1 centeralign" | 1
| class="col2" | -128 to 127
| class="col3" | <code></code>
|- class="row2"
! class="col0 centeralign" | short
| class="col1 centeralign" | 2
| class="col2" | -32768 to 32767
| class="col3" | <code></code>
|- class="row3"
! class="col0 centeralign" | Integer
| class="col1 centeralign" | 4
| class="col2" | -2147483648 to 2147483647
| class="col3" | <code></code>
|- class="row4"
! class="col0 centeralign" | Long
| class="col1 centeralign" | 8
| class="col2" | 
| class="col3" | <code></code>
|- class="row5"
! class="col0 centeralign" | MAGIC
| class="col1 centeralign" | 16
| class="col2" | <code>0x00ffff00fefefefefdfdfdfd12345678</code>
| class="col3" | always those hex bytes, corresponding to RakNet's default OFFLINE_MESSAGE_DATA_ID
|- class="row6"
! class="col0 centeralign" | string
| class="col1 centeralign" | short + string
| class="col2" | N/A
| class="col3" | Prefixed by a short containing the length of the string in characters. It appears that only the following ASCII characters can be displayed: !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~

== Reference ==

RakNet datagram and message header information: http://im/raknet/manual/systemoverview.html

The latest version of the protocol is not fully documented yet, but all of the packets can be found in the [http://dragonet.org Dragonet] server code  https://github.com/DragonetMC/Dragonet/tree/master/src/main/java/org/dragonet/net/packet

There is also an automatically generated specification of many of the packages can be found in the MiNET server code  https://github.com/NiclasOlofsson/MiNET/blob/master/src/MiNET/MiNET/Net/MCPE%20Protocol%20Documentation.md

The MiNET wiki also contain development notes around some functionality https://github.com/NiclasOlofsson/MiNET/wiki These will be migrated to this wiki in due time.
