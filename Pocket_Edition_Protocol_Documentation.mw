This is the (unofficial) protocol documentation for {{Minecraft Wiki|Minecraft Pocket Edition}}. The protocol currently uses [[Wikipedia:UDP|UDP]] for communication, different from PC (which uses [[Wikipedia:TCP|TCP]]). The usual UDP issues are still here (lost packets, wrong order, etc.), but the protocol solves a few of those problems using special packet encapsulation, based on TCP. The Minecraft: PE client uses [http://www.raknet.com/ RakNet] as its networking library. Even though it uses RakNet, you can still write software without the library.

Currently, the game's default port is 19132. It is recommended to use this when possible because processes such as server discovering will not work otherwise.

== Data Types ==
Minecraft packets use different data types to communicate with each other. The documented ones are listed below:

{| class="wikitable"
|- class="row0"
| class="col0" |
! class="col1" | Size
! class="col2" | Range
! class="col3" | Notes
|- class="row1"
! class="col0 centeralign" | byte
| class="col1 centeralign" | 1
| class="col2" | -128 to 127
| class="col3" | <code></code>
|- class="row2"
! class="col0 centeralign" | short
| class="col1 centeralign" | 2
| class="col2" | -32768 to 32767
| class="col3" | <code></code>
|- class="row3"
! class="col0 centeralign" | int
| class="col1 centeralign" | 4
| class="col2" | -2147483648 to 2147483647
| class="col3" | <code></code>
|- class="row4"
! class="col0 centeralign" | long
| class="col1 centeralign" | 8
| class="col2" | 
| class="col3" | <code></code>
|- class="row5"
! class="col0 centeralign" | MAGIC
| class="col1 centeralign" | 16
| class="col2" | <code>0x00ffff00fefefefefdfdfdfd12345678</code>
| class="col3" | always those hex bytes, corresponding to RakNet's default OFFLINE_MESSAGE_DATA_ID
|- class="row6"
! class="col0 centeralign" | string
| class="col1 centeralign" | unsigned short + string
| class="col2" | N/A
| class="col3" | Prefixed by a short containing the length of the string in characters. It appears that only the following ASCII characters can be displayed: !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~
|}

== Packet format ==
All packets in Minecraft: Pocket Edition start with their ID, which is an unsigned byte. If you are using a language which does not support unsigned types such as Java, you can do (byte & 0xFF) to get the unsigned version.

The latest version of the protocol is not fully documented yet, but all of the packets can be found in the [http://dragonet.org Dragonet] server code  https://github.com/DragonetMC/Dragonet/tree/master/src/main/java/org/dragonet/net/packet
Protocol Version: 23 (MCPE 0.11.0b6)

The older protocol specification(ver <= 0.10.x): 
There is also an automatically generated specification of many of the packages can be found in the MiNET server code  https://github.com/NiclasOlofsson/MiNET/blob/master/src/MiNET/MiNET/Net/MCPE%20Protocol%20Documentation.md

The MiNET wiki also contain development notes around some functionality https://github.com/NiclasOlofsson/MiNET/wiki These will be migrated to this wiki in due time.
