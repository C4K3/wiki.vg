The '''slot''' data structure is how Minecraft represents an item and its associated data in the [[Protocol|minecraft protocol]]

== Format ==

The structure consists of at least a short, which gives the item/block ID [http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Block_ids]. A value of <code>-1</code> signifies that the slot is empty, and no further data follows.

If the block ID is not <code>-1</code>, three more fields follow. These fields are a byte (item count), a short (item damage) and another byte.

If the byte is <code>0</code>, there is no NBT data, and no further data follows. Otherwise the byte is the start of the nbt blob

The format of this data is as follows:

<code>
  COMPOUND: <nowiki>''</nowiki>
    LIST: 'ench'
      COMPOUND
        SHORT: 'id'
        SHORT: 'lvl'
      END
      COMPOUND
        ...etc
      END
  END
</code>

Each of the inner, untagged COMPOUNDs represents an enchantment, with its ID[http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Enchantment#Enchantment_Types] and level given as child SHORT elements.

See [[NBT]] for more information about the NBT format.

== Examples ==

<code>
  ff ff                            | empty slot
  01 16 01 00 00 00                | a diamond pickaxe
  01 16 01 00 00 01 04 CA FE BA BE | a diamond pickaxe with (made-up) NBT data
</code>
