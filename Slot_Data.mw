The '''Slot''' data structure is how Minecraft represents an item and its associated data in the [[Protocol|Minecraft Protocol]].

== Format ==

The structure consists of at least a short, which gives the item/block ID [http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Block_ids]. A value of <code>-1</code> signifies that the slot is empty, and no further data follows.

If the block ID is not <code>-1</code>, three more fields follow. These fields are a byte (item count), a short (item damage) and at least another byte.

If the byte is <code>0</code>, there is no NBT data, and no further data follows. Otherwise the byte is the start of an NBT blob of the following format:

<pre>
  COMPOUND <nowiki>''</nowiki>
    LIST 'StoredEnchantments'
      COMPOUND
        SHORT 'id'
        SHORT 'lvl'
      END
      COMPOUND
        ...
      END
      ...
    END
    INT 'Unbreakable'
    ...
  END
</pre>

See [[NBT]] for more information about the NBT format, and [http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Player.dat_format#Item_structure here] for the contained information and its format.

== Examples ==

<pre>
  ff ff                            | empty slot
  01 16 01 00 00 00                | a diamond pickaxe
  01 16 01 00 00 01 04 CA FE BA BE | a diamond pickaxe with (made-up) NBT data
</pre>
