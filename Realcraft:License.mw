== License ==

Realcraft is written as open-source at [https://github.com/Jailout2000/Realcraft github]. If there is no LICENSE file over at Github, then assume general public / proprietary software, otherwise refer to that file for the license.

Also note that the github repository is not where the source will live. The source lives on my hard drive until I feel like uploading it to git. I will be using github for a backup of Realcraft's source only, and not as the main source.

== Disclaimer ==
Your use of Realcraft is subject to these terms and conditions.

# No warranty will be given by using the server.
# I am not responsible for any issues you may encounter while using Realcraft. Use at your own risk.
# I will not help you should you have any questions if you will not give me an understandable question; use your head and commonsense. Use proper grammar and spelling, even if I don't. I only fully understand English (United States). I will answer most questions if I know what you're asking.
# Once you have the server, it's yours. Do what you want with it as long as you do not steal the Realcraft name, be creative if it comes to that point.
