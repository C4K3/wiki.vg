This tutorial is being created to document what it takes to write a stand-alone server to interact with Notchian clients. The tutorial is incomplete but will be updated whenever more information is discovered.

== Before You Get Started ==
* Make sure you don't want to fork or join an [[Server_List|existing project]].
* Wonder why you want to do this in the first place.
* Choose a language that has good networking, like Java, C#, or Python. (If you want to be different, choose a faster language like C or Rust!)

== If you're not using a wrapper/library ==
If you're not using a wrapper/library, then you'll need to do all the dirty work by hand.

=== Accepting TCP Packets ===
The Minecraft server accepts connections from TCP clients and communicates with them using ''packets''. A packet is a sequence of bytes sent over the TCP connection. The meaning of a packet depends both on its packet ID and the current state of the connection. The initial state of each connection is [[Protocol#Handshaking|Handshaking]], and state is switched using the packets [[Protocol#Handshake|Handshake]] ([[Protocol#Handshaking|Handshaking]], 0x00, serverbound) and [[Protocol#Login Success|Login Success]] ([[Protocol#Login|Login]], 0x02, clientbound). You can read more about Minecraft Packets on the [[Protocol|Protocol page]].

== [[Server List Ping]] ==
Your server needs to accept a Handshake(0x00 with state=1) and a Request packet, which you'll respond with a Response packet including JSON detailing the server. You can rad more about this on the [[Server List Ping]] page.
