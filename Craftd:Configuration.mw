After building and installing craftd, you will need to move the config files into place.  craftd looks for the main config file in the following order:
* ~/.craftd/craftd.conf
* /etc/craftd/craftd.conf
* /usr/local/etc/craftd/craftd.conf
* Current working directory (useful for developers)


By default, these are located in $prefix/etc/craftd/ as *.dist files so as not to overwrite existing configs when you install updates.

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
cd /usr/local/etc
mv craftd.conf.dist craftd.conf
</syntaxhighlight>

A config file is necessary, but options may be omitted in which case the defaults will be used.  If the file fails to parse, an error message will be logged.

== Default configuration file ==
'''craftd.conf.dist''' - Using this configuration file will not change any of the internal default variables.

== Available options and their defaults ==
'''THIS IS STALE, NEED REWRITE!!'''
