After building and installing craftd, you will need to move the config files into place.  craftd looks for the main config file in the following order:
* ~/.craftd/craftd.conf
* /etc/craftd/craftd.conf
* /usr/local/etc/craftd/craftd.conf
* Current working directory (useful for developers)


By default, these are located in $prefix/etc/craftd/ as *.dist files so as not to overwrite existing configs when you install updates.

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
cd /usr/local/etc
mv craftd.conf.dist craftd.conf
mv motd.conf.dist motd.conf
</syntaxhighlight>

A config file is necessary, but it can consist of nothing more than {} if you wish to accept the defaults.  Options may be omitted, in which case the defaults will be used.  If the file fails to parse, an error message will be logged.
