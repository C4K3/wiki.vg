'''THIS IS DEPRECATED, NEED REWRITE'''


After building and installing craftd, you will need to move the config files into place.  craftd looks for the main config file in the following order:
* ~/.craftd/craftd.conf
* /etc/craftd/craftd.conf
* /usr/local/etc/craftd/craftd.conf
* Current working directory (useful for developers)


By default, these are located in $prefix/etc/craftd/ as *.dist files so as not to overwrite existing configs when you install updates.

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
cd /usr/local/etc
mv craftd.conf.dist craftd.conf
mv motd.conf.dist motd.conf
</syntaxhighlight>

A config file is necessary, but it can consist of nothing more than {} if you wish to accept the defaults.  Options may be omitted, in which case the defaults will be used.  If the file fails to parse, an error message will be logged.

== Default configuration file ==
Using this configuration file will not change any of the internal default variables
