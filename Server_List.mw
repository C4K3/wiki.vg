This is a rather incomplete list of Minecraft Beta servers currently in development. This page only lists servers written from scratch. For mods and wrappers, see the [[Utility List]].

A couple things for contributors:
* If you haven't committed to your repo in a few months, I (MAD) am likely to mark you as on hiatus. Don't take it personally; just write more code and update the wiki.
* I (MAD) rely on READMEs to gather server features. If you don't have one, you run the risk that I will read your source code to discern what your server can do. This might not be what you wanted. >:3
* Yes, the "Networking" column really does ask the question, "Can your server actually talk to clients?" This is just a litmus test. If your server can't do it, then consider whether it's ready for this page.
