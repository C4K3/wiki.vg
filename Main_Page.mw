== Alpha ==
[[File:Banner alpha.png|link=Minecraft Alpha]]

Minecraft Alpha is the latest (and only updated) version of Minecraft which requires a paid account to download, update and play. Most of the new development projects focus on either creating entirely new programs from scratch that interoperate with Minecraft (such as a bot or server) or modding projects that wrap the client or server and provide bug fixes, new features and enhancements to existing features.

=== Documentation ===
There are ongoing efforts to keep reverse engineered documentation updated, but it isn't as easy as it sounds. The protocol generally changes with each release, and both the Client and Server classes get rearranged on each release. Below are links to the current documentation segments, which '''may or may not be accurate'''.
* [[Protocol|Protocol Specification]]
* [[Protocol FAQ]]
* [[Authentication|Authentication Scheme]]
* [[Map Format]]

=== Source Code & Snippets ===
Source code snippets provide insight into how specific features work or can be accomplished, and by themselves are generally free to use in your own program.
* [[:Category:Code Snippets|More...]]

=== Tools and Mods ===
* [[Client List|Clients]] - third-party SMP clients.
* [[Server List|Servers]] - third-party SMP servers.
* [[Library List|Libraries]] - libraries to interface with Minecraft data files or network protocols.
* [[Utility List|Utilities]] - tools that interface with a client, server, or data files, such as proxies, bots, mods, or inventory editors.

== Classic ==
[[File:Banner classic.png|link=Minecraft Classic]]

Minecraft Classic is the original version of Minecraft, available for free to the public. It's still available off of the main website today and is still played by many people, with an active development community. As it's been around for almost a year, and because it's so simplistic, there are many, many programs made to work with Classic - there are over '''18+''' servers alone, written in everything from C++ to PureBasic to Perl. It's highly recommend if you're planning to do a development project at this point to instead look into the Minecraft Alpha specifications.

=== Documentation ===
As there is no longer any work being done on classic, the documentation for it is stable. If you create something that works with it, it probably always will.
* [[Classic Protocol|Protocol Specification]]
* [[Classic DAT Format|Server Map Format (.dat)]]
* [[MCLevel Format|Saved Level Format (.mclevel)]]

=== Source Code Snippets ===
Source code snippets provide insight into how specific features work or can be accomplished, and by themselves are generally free to use in your own program.
* Deserializing the level.dat file format ([[deserialize.c|C]], [[deserialize.cs|C#]])
* [[Skins.php]], a script to generate a preview image from a Minecraft skin file (PHP).
* [[:Category:Code Snippets|More...]]
