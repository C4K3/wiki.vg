People very, very often have questions regarding the Minecraft Alpha [[Protocol]], so we'll try to address some of the most common ones on this document. If you're still having trouble, join us on IRC, channel #mcdevs on irc.freenode.net.

===Is the protocol documentation complete?===
<blockquote>
Depending on your definition, '''yes'''! All packet types are known and their layout documented. Some finer details are missing, but everything you need to make functional programs is present. We [[MC-Ver|have a script]] that monitors for new versions of the client and notifies us, allowing us to quickly document new packets.
</blockquote>

===What's the normal login sequence for a client?===

See [[Authentication]] for communication with minecraft.net

<blockquote>
The recommended login sequence looks like this, where C is the client and S is the server:<br /><br />

C ↔ S : Connects<br />
C → S : Sends handshake<br />
C ← S : Sends handshake response<br />
C → S : After authenticating (if needed), sends the login packet<br />
C ← S : Either kicks (invalid login) or sends a login response<br />
C ← S : Sends pre-chunks and chunks and entities<br />
C ← S : Sends spawn position<br />
C ← S : Sends inventory [Need to verify this since inventory changed] (beta 1.1_02: looks like Window items with type=0, then a Set slot with window id = -1 and slot = -1)<br />
C ← S : Tell the client they're ready to spawn by sending a position + look packet. '''Note''': The stance and Y should be swapped when the server sends it to the client (See [[protocol#player_position_look_0x0d|Protocol Page]])!<br />
C → S : Sends a position + look packet to confirm the spawn position, with the stance and Y swapped back to the correct positions<br />
</blockquote>

===I think I've done everything right, but my player isn't spawning===
<blockquote>
After sending the common-sense packets ([[protocol#handshake_0x02|Handshake]], [[protocol#login_request_0x01|Login]], [[protocol#player_inventory_0x05|Inventory]], [[protocol#spawn_position_0x06|Compass]] and [[protocol#pre-chunk_0x32|Pre-chunk]]/[[protocol#map_chunk_0x33|Chunk]] pairs) you need to finally send the player their [[protocol#player_position_look_0x0d|initial position]] for them to leave the "Loading Map" screen.
