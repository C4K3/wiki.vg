Chat strings are subject to myriad limitations imposed by defects in the Notchian server and client, and also have special meanings for certain characters.

== Character Set ==

The following list of characters is known to be supported by the Notchian server:
<blockquote>
<code>
"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\\]^_'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~⌂ÇüéâäàåçêëèïîìÄÅÉæÆôöòûùÿÖÜø£Ø×ƒáíóúñÑªº¿®¬½¼¡«»"
</code>
</blockquote>

Characters not in this list will cause Notchian servers to kick clients, and Notchian clients to choke and die horribly.

== Colors ==

The Notchian client has support for colorized text. To select a color, a color escape code, similar to an ANSI color escape code, is inserted to change the color of the following characters.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Character !! Color
|-
| 0 || Black
|-
| 1 || Dark blue
|-
| 2 || Dark green
|-
| 3 || Dark cyan
|-
| 4 || Dark red
|-
| 5 || Dark magenta
|-
| 6 || Dark orange
|-
| 7 || Gray
|-
| 8 || Dark gray
|-
| 9 || Blue
|-
| a || Green
|-
| b || Cyan
|-
| c || Red
|-
| d || Magenta
|-
| e || Yellow
|-
| f || White
|}

These correspond very roughly to the colors available in ANSI terminals.

A color escape code is created by combining the control character § (U+00A7) with the character specifying the color; thus, "§4" selects dark red as the color for the following text.
