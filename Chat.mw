Chat strings are subject to myriad limitations imposed by defects in the Notchian server and client.

== Character Set ==

The following list of characters is known to be supported by the Notchian server:
<blockquote>
<code>
"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\\]^_'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~⌂ÇüéâäàåçêëèïîìÄÅÉæÆôöòûùÿÖÜø£Ø×ƒáíóúñÑªº¿®¬½¼¡«»"
</code>
</blockquote>

Characters not in this list will cause Notchian servers to kick clients, and Notchian clients to choke and die horribly.
