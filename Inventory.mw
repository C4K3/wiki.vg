Minecraft displays the '''player inventory''' differently, according to how the window was opened. Ranges of slot indices vary in meaning between different “windows”. The [[Protocol#Open Inventory|Open Inventory]] packet indicates which window is being opened according to:

The slot number is calculated starting at 0, counting up through the window's unique slots, and then counting through the players inventory.

For all windows, the slot in the upper-left corner of the player's inventory is slot ''n'' where ''n'' is the number of unique slots, and slot number -999 is always used for clicking outside the window.

The number of unique slots in the window is sent in the [[Protocol#Open Window|Open Window]] ([[Protocol#Play|Play]], 0x2d, clientbound) packet for all storage windows (e.g. Chest, Dropper). For non-storage windows (the items get dropped when the window is closed, e.g. Workbench, Anvil), the received number of unique slots is always 0, but it can be looked up by the client from the window type.

The default inventory window, which is never explicitly opened by the server, has 9 unique slots (10 in the [[Pre-release protocol|1.9 snapshots]]).

Rectangular regions are always indexed starting with the upper-left corner and scanning across rows. If a window has a crafting region, the output slot is always slot 0 followed immediately by the input region.

Each window type is described in the following sections. All slot index ranges are inclusive and reflect the indices observed in the Minecraft protocol.

For the window properties (additional data in each window, e.g. smelting progress or enchantments), refer to the table in the [[Protocol#Window_Property|Window Property]] packet.

Using -1 as slot index and as window id will set the cursor item (the stack dragged with the mouse).
