Minecraft displays the '''player inventory''' differently, according to how the window was opened. Ranges of slot indices vary in meaning between different “windows”. Minecraft indicates which window is being opened according to:

The slot number is calculated starting at 0, counting up through the window's unique slots, and then counting through the players inventory. The number of unique slots in the window is in the [[Protocol#Open Window|Open Window]] ([[Protocol#Play|Play]], 0x2d, clientbound) packet for all window types except the default inventory window, in which the number of unique slots is 9. This means the slot in the upper-left corner of the player's inventory is slot ''n'' where ''n'' is the number of unique slots. Slot number -999 is used for clicking outside the window.

Rectangular regions are always indexed starting with the upper-left corner and scanning across rows. If a window has a crafting region, the output slot is always slot 0 followed immediately by the input region.

Each window type is described in the following sections. All slot index ranges are inclusive and reflect the indices observed in the Minecraft protocol.

For the window properties (additional data in each window, e.g. smelting progress or enchantments), refer to the table in the [[Protocol#Window_Property|Window Property]] packet.

== Inventory ==
[[File:Inventory-slots.png|thumb|Inventory slots]]

This is the inventory window that the player can always open, typically by pressing {{Key|E}} since {{Minecraft Wiki|Beta 1.4}}. Before, you had to press {{Key|I}}.

Note that this is different from inventory items stored in a player.dat file. This may help: [https://gist.github.com/459a1691c3dd751db160 https://gist.github.com/459a1691c3dd751db160]
