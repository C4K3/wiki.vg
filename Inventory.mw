== Windows ==

Minecraft displays the player inventory differently, according to how the window was opened. Ranges of slot indices vary in meaning between different "windows". Minecraft indicates which window is being opened according to:

{| class="wikitable"
|- class="row0"
! class="col0" | Inventory Type
! class="col1" | Description
|- class="row1"
| class="col0" | 0
| class="col1" | Chest/Large chest
|- class="row2"
| class="col0" | 1
| class="col1" | Workbench
|- class="row3"
| class="col0" | 2
| class="col1" | Furnace
|- class="row4"
| class="col0" | 3
| class="col1" | Dispenser
|}

Each window type is described in the following sections. All slot index ranges are inclusive and reflect the indices observed in the Minecraft Beta protocol. Generally rectangular regions' slot indices start from the top-left corner, and increase from left to right, and then onto the next row.
