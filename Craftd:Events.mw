== Events ==
Events are the main way of acting with a craftd Server. Plugins work by registering to events and dispatching events.

An event callback has at least 1 parameter, which is the Server that the event was dispatched on, then other parameters are simply passed with some C magic. Remember to use only types that would work with a va_arg, this means use int/long even if a short/char is passed and use double instead of float, you can typecast them later, using smaller types would cause the data to be wrong. Pointers are always safe.

The event callback HAS to return true, if you return false the event chain is stopped, in this way your plugin can stop the chain of events.

You can also register to "Event.dispatch:before" and "Event.dispatch:after", these events are special events, and are called everytime an event is dispatched, other than the server a string parameter with the name of the event is passed, and a va_list. In this way you can inspect the event being called and abort it even before it's called, or act after an event as been called.
