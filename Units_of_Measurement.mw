There are several different units of measurement used in the protocol depending on what is being described. For example, it wouldn't make much sense to send the position of a block (which is a constant multiple of 32) in a floating point double.

A block represents 1 meter x 1 meter x 1 meter. There are 32 pixels per meter, and chunks are 16m x 128m x 16m.
