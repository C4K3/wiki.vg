'''Realcraft''' is a custom (third-party) Minecraft server written in [http://www.realbasic.com/ Realbasic] by [[User:Jailout2000|Jailout2000]]. It implements the [http://www.minecraft.net/ Minecraft] 1.1 server protocols. The server runs out of the console; it does not have a GUI to which you could control it.

The server is being written for Windows mainly but will also be compatible with Linux. I plan to support Mac OS X in the future, but currently it is not supported.

I offer my services through any of my contact names, or through IRC ([irc://irc.freenode.net/#realcraft irc.freenode.net#realcraft]).

When I am coding Realcraft, you can find the live server at <code>mc.clan-warp.net:25566</code>.

Eventually Realcraft will become a duplicate of the [http://innectis.net/ Innectis] community's server. This is a long-term goal.
