[[Realcraft]] is a custom Minecraft server built around the Beta 1.8.1 protocol by [[User:Jailout2000|Jailout2000]]. It is coded in REALbasic, a crappy language but very easy to use and learn. Since it's coded in REALbasic, this means that it does not have access to kernel threads, and therefore is not a multi-threaded server. The server runs out of the console; it does not have a GUI to which you can control it.

== License ==

Realcraft is written as closed source, therefore it is not available to the general public. If you really wish to see the source, message Jailout2000.

== Project Status ==

Currently the project is in '''active''' development.

=== Plans ===

* Eventually use an external library for generation of worlds. At the moment, generation of worlds is done internally, and is not very impressive (just flat worlds with some scenery).
* Provide a download for the server so others may use it.
** This will mean building the server for cross-platform support. Currently it is Windows only.
* Player authentication with Minecraft.net.
* MySQL database support.
* Advertise the server to others, so that it can be stress tested.

=== Live Server ===

This server may or may not be online; it's only online when Jailout2000 is working on the server.
* mc.clan-warp.net:25566

Y points upwards, X points South, and Z points West.

=== Logging ===
The logger is called whenever there is text displayed to the command line. Whatever you see on screen is also sent to a file. The only exception to this rule is when Realcraft is displaying a percentile of an action being done (i.e. ''Generating world... 50%''), in this case the file does not get updated until the full line is displayed (''Generating world... done.'') or when there's an error while doing the action.

All logs are stored in the folder called '''Logs''' under the folder '''Realcraft''' inside the application data folder of your system. On Windows Vista and newer, this is your %APPDATA% folder (C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Roaming).

The filename is always in the format '''YYYY-MM-DD.log''' where YYYY is the year, MM is the month, and DD is the day of the month.
