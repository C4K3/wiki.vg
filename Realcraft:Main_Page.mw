[[Realcraft]] is a custom Minecraft Beta server coded by [[User:Jailout2000|Jailout2000]] around the Beta 1.8.1 protocol. It is coded in REALbasic, a crappy language but very easy to use and learn. Since it's coded in REALbasic, this means that it does not have access to kernel threads, and therefore is not a multi-threaded server. The server runs out of the console; it does not have a GUI to which you can control it.

== License ==

Realcraft is written as closed source, therefore it is not available to the general public. If you really wish to see the source, message Jailout2000.

== Project Status ==

Currently the project is in '''temporary inactive''' development.

=== Plans ===

* Eventually use an external library for generation of worlds. At the moment, generation of worlds is done internally, and is not very impressive (just flat worlds with some scenery).
* Provide a download for the server so others may use it.
** This will mean building the server for cross-platform support. Currently it is Windows only.
* Player authentication with Minecraft.net.
* MySQL database support.
* Advertise the server to others, so that it can be stress tested.

=== Live Server ===

This server may or may not be online; it's only online when Jailout2000 is working on the server.
* mc.clan-warp.net:25566

=== Source Code ===

The project source is '''closed/private''', and '''available upon request'''. If you would like to see the source, message [[User:Jailout2000|Jailout2000]]. He would have released it to the general public, but the problem with that is REALbasic isn't equipped to handle separation of files for things like github or Google Code; the closest thing it has is separated files in <span title="RealBasic Version Control Project">RBVCP</span> format, which include #tag lines that you don't see in the Real Studio IDE, so it would make no sense to use it.

== Development Status ==

Server has been rewritten with a new packet buffering system. It's now much easier for me to do things with the Minecraft protocol as opposed to before. The reason for the rewrite is because A) it was mostly hard to maintain and B) I lost the source code in a hard drive failure. Right now the rewrite is at the point of where the earlier version was; you can run around but don't swing your arm or click anything, don't even walk or jog. -- [[User:Jailout2000|<span style="color: #0080C0; font-weight: bold;">Jailout2000</span>]] 19:33, 2 January 2012 (MST)

Development will begin again soon. -- [[User:Jailout2000|<span style="color: #0080C0; font-weight: bold;">Jailout2000</span>]] 08:40, 30 December 2011 (MST)

Notchian clients no longer crash. Lots of internal code has been reworked with the help of [[User:Ribose|Ribose]]. Fixed spawning bugs, it now works correctly on the first time. Fixed gltches with walking/jumping/arm-throwing; you are now free to walk around, just don't hit any blocks (left or right click) at the moment ;). Entities were worked on a bit, and understood a bit more; players should now see other players (but they cannot move right now, they can arm swing though!). Chat is now working properly, and is logged under a different log file. Other than all of this, the server is fairly stable, I can't crash it as of this moment, but that's not to say it isn't crashable, I'm sure somewhere there's a problem. -- [[User:Jailout2000|<span style="color: #0080C0; font-weight: bold;">Jailout2000</span>]] 22:27, 24 October 2011 (MST)
