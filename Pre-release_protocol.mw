''Server to Client''

Time is based on ticks, where 20 ticks happen every second. There are 24000 ticks in a day, making Minecraft days exactly 20 minutes long. 

The time of day is based on the timestamp modulo 24000. 0 is sunrise, 6000 is noon, 12000 is sunset, and 18000 is midnight. 

The default SMP server increments both by 20 every second. 

The &#39;Time&#39; is the Age of the world. It is not changing on server commands and will increased by 20 every second.
