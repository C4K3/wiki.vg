'''Maps'''
If the first byte of the text is 0, the next two bytes are X start and Y start and the rest of the bytes are the colors in that column.

If the first byte of the text is 1, the rest of the bytes are in groups of three: (data, x, y). The lower half of the data is the type (always 0 under vanilla) and the upper half is the direction.

== Changed Data Types ==

Entity Metadata has an additional field for Slot data types. It now has a short (-1) at the end if there is no further data, or that short is the length
of the following NBT array, presumably gzipped NBT data.

== Removed Packets ==
-None-
