==== Player Digging ====
{| class="wikitable"
! Packet ID !! Field Name !! Field Type !! Notes
|-
| rowspan="5" | 0x07
| Status || Byte || The action the player is taking against the block (see below)
|-
| X || Int || Block position
|-
| Y || Byte || Block position
|-
| Z || Int || Block position
|-
| Face || Byte || The face being hit (see below)
|}

Status can (currently) be one of six values:

{| class="wikitable"
! Meaning !! Value
|-
| Started digging || <code>0</code>
|-
| Cancelled digging || <code>1</code>
|-
| Finished digging || <code>2</code>
|-
| Drop item stack || <code>3</code>
|-
| Drop item || <code>4</code>
|-
| Shoot arrow / finish eating || <code>5</code>
|}

Notchian clients send a 0 (started digging) when they start digging and a 2 (finished digging) once they think they are finished. If digging is aborted, the client simply send a 1 (Cancel digging).

Status code 4 (drop item) is a special case.  In-game, when you use the Drop Item command (keypress 'q'), a dig packet with a status of 4, and all other values set to 0, is sent from client to server. Status code 3 is similar, but drops the entire stack.

Status code 5 (shoot arrow / finish eating) is also a special case. The x, y and z fields are all set to 0 like above, with the exception of the face field, which is set to 255.

The face can be one of six values, representing the face being hit:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Value || 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5
|-
| Offset || -Y || +Y || -Z || +Z || -X || +X
|}

In 1.7.3, when a player opens a door with left click the server receives Packet 0xE+start digging and opens the door.

==== Player Block Placement ====
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Packet ID !! Field Name !! Field Type !! Notes
|-
| rowspan="8" | 0x08
| X || Int || Block position
|-
| Y || Unsigned Byte || Block position
|-
| Z || Int || Block position
|-
| Direction || Byte || The offset to use for block/item placement (see below)
|-
| Held item || [[Slot_Data|Slot]] ||
|-
| Cursor position X || Byte || The position of the crosshair on the block
|-
| Cursor position Y || Byte ||
|-
| Cursor position Z || Byte ||
|}
In normal operation (ie placing a block), this packet is sent once, with the values set normally.

This packet has a special case where X, Y, Z, and Direction are all -1. (Note that Y is unsigned so set to 255.) This special packet indicates that the currently held item for the player should have its state updated such as eating food, shooting bows, using buckets, etc.

In a Notchian Beta client, the block or item ID corresponds to whatever the client is currently holding, and the client sends one of these packets any time a right-click is issued on a surface, so no assumptions can be made about the safety of the ID.  However, with the implementation of server-side inventory, a Notchian server seems to ignore the item ID, instead operating on server-side inventory information and holding selection. The client has been observed (1.2.5 and 1.3.2) to send both real item IDs and -1 in a single session.

Special note on using buckets:  When using buckets, the Notchian client might send two packets:  first a normal and then a special case.  The first normal packet is sent when you're looking at a block (e.g. the water you want to scoop up).  This normal packet does not appear to do anything with a Notchian server.  The second, special case packet appears to perform the action - based on current position/orientation and with a distance check - it appears that buckets can only be used within a radius of 6 units.

==== Held Item Change ====

See [[Inventory#Windows|inventory windows]] for further information about how slots are indexed.

When right-clicking on a stack of items, half the stack will be picked up and half left in the slot.  If the stack is an odd number, the half left in the slot will be smaller of the amounts.

The Action number is actually a counter, starting at 1.  This number is used by the server as a transaction ID to send back a [[#0x6A|Transaction packet]].

The distinct type of click performed by the client is determined by the combination of the "Mode" and "Button" fields.

Starting from version 1.5, "painting mode" is available for use in inventory windows. It is done by picking up stack of something (more than 1 items), then holding mouse button (left, right or middle) and dragging holded stack over empty (or same type in case of right button ) slots. In that case client sends the following to server after mouse button release (omitting first pickup packet which is sent as usual):

# packet with mode 5, slot -999 , button (0 for left | 4 for right);
# packet for every slot painted on, mode is still 5, button (1 | 5);
# packet with mode 5, slot -999, button (2 | 6);

If any of the painting packets other than the "progress" ones are sent out of order (for example, a start, some slots, then another start; or a left-click in the middle) the painting status will be reset.

== Status ==
The status ping works as follows. 
    C->S : Handshake State=1
    C->S : Request
    S->C : Response
    C->S : Ping
    S->C : Ping

=== Clientbound ===

== Login ==

The login process is as follows:
    C->S : Handshake State=2
    C->S : Login Start
    S->C : Encryption Key Request
    C->S : Encryption Key Response
    (Auth & enable encryption)
    S->C : Login Success

For unauthenticated and* localhost connections there is no encryption.
In that case Login Start is directly followed by Login Success.

\*It could be that only one of the two conditions is enough for an unencrypted connection.
