== Changed packets ==

=== "Slot" type change ===

Four packets changed:

* [[Protocol#Player_Block_Placement_.280x0F.29|0x0F player block placement]]
* [[Protocol#Window_click_.280x66.29|0x66 window click]]
* [[Protocol#Set_slot_.280x67.29|0x67 set slot]]
* [[Protocol#Window_items_.280x68.29|0x68 window items]]
* 0x6B Create Inventory

This change affects the "slot" datatype. This type consists of at least a short (item_id). If this id isn't <code>-1</code>, a byte (count) and a short (uses) follow.

From 1.9pre2 onward, additional data is sent but only for [https://gist.github.com/1268479 certain item_ids]. This means the protocol is no longer context free. The additional data is ''at least'' a short. If this short isn't -1, a byte[] array follows, containing ''gzipped'' NBT data

As of 1.9pre3, the format of the NBT is as follows

<code>
  COMPOUND
    LIST: 'ench'
      SHORT: 'id'
      SHORT: 'lvl'
    END
  END
</code>

=== Experience (0x2B) ===

Now float, short, short

== Other changes ==
