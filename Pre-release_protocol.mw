==== Tab-Complete (clientbound) ====

The server responds with a list of auto-completions of the last word sent to it. In the case of regular chat, this is a player username. Command names and parameters are also supported. {{change|The client lists these in the order that they are in the array.|The client sorts these alphabetically before listing them.}}

“Hide” makes the title disappear, but if you run times again the same title will appear. “Reset” erases the text.

The title is visible on screen for Fade In + Stay + Fade Out ticks.

==== Collect Item ====

Sent by the server when someone picks up an item lying on the ground — its sole purpose appears to be the animation of the item flying towards you. It doesn't destroy the entity in the client memory, and it doesn't add it to your inventory. The server only checks for items to be picked up after each [[#Player Position|Player Position]] (and [[#Player Position And Look|Player Position And Look]]) packet sent by the client.

==== Chat Message (serverbound) ====

Used to send a chat message to the server.  The message may not be longer than {{change|100|256}} characters or else the server will kick the client.

If the message starts with a <code>/</code>, the server will attempt to interpret it as a command.  Otherwise, the server will broadcast the same chat message to all players on the server (including the player that sent the message), prepended with player's name.  Specifically, it will respond with a translate [[chat]] component, "<code>chat.type.text</code>" with the first parameter set to the display name of the player (including some chat component logic to support clicking the name to send a PM) and the second parameter set to the message.
