== Game ==

All available version of the game itself are listed on
: https://launchermeta.mojang.com/mc/game/version_manifest.json

The location of the client jar file for a specific version is included in the version manifest above. Alternatively it can also be found at
: <nowiki>https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/versions/<version>/<version>.jar</nowiki>

The server jar file and its .exe equivalent for a specific version are located at
: <nowiki>https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/versions/<version>/minecraft_server.<version>.jar</nowiki>
: <nowiki>https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/versions/<version>/minecraft_server.<version>.exe</nowiki>

Some information on how to properly run said jar is included in the version manifest as an URL. It can also be found  at
: <nowiki>https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/versions/<version>/<version>.json</nowiki>

{{Warning|As the Minecraft launcher updates, the format of the JSON or the requirements to run the client may change. The ''minimumLauncherVersion'' in the <version>.json should be used to detect changes instead of just failing on updates.}}

== Libraries ==
The libraries which can be used for all minecraft versions and are downloaded by the launcher are located at
  https://libraries.minecraft.net/

The json file downloaded above is used in order to determine which libraries to download. Inside the file is a key, <code>libraries</code> which contains information about each library required.
Example:
<syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
{
  "name": "org.lwjgl.lwjgl:lwjgl-platform:2.9.1-nightly-20130708-debug3",
  "natives": {
    "linux": "natives-linux",
    "windows": "natives-windows",
    "osx": "natives-osx"
  },
  "extract": {
    "exclude": [
      "META-INF/"
    ]
  },
  "rules": [
    {
      "action": "allow",
      "os": {
        "name": "osx",
        "version": "^10\\.5\\.\\d$"
      }
    }
  ]
}
</syntaxhighlight>

The <code>name</code> key is used to determine the url from which to download the library from. The format of this string is
 <package>:<name>:<version>
The corresponding URL would look like this:
 https://libraries.minecraft.net/<package>/<name>/<version>/<name>-<version>.jar
where <code>path</code> is the result of replacing all the periods in <code>package</code> with slashes.

It also download a hash, in sha1, the url is:
 https://libraries.minecraft.net/<package>/<name>/<version>/<name>-<version>.jar.sha1

{{Warning | http://libraries.minecraft.net/ will NOT work - you must use https}}

The <code>natives</code> key provides a string for each specific platform to be inserted between the .jar and the <version> of the filename, resulting in a filename with the format:
 <name>-<version>-<native-string>.jar
This is applied to any file with the <code>natives</code> key.
The natives string may contain <code>${arch}</code>, which should be replaced with <code>32</code> or <code>64</code>.


The <code>extract</code> key provides rules for the extraction of the file.


The <code>rules</code> key is used to determine which platforms to download the file to. When the <code>action</code> is <code>allow</code>, the file will be downloaded to the platform stated in <code>os</code>. When the <code>action</code> is <code>disallow</code>, the file will not be downloaded to the platform stated in <code>os</code>. If there is no <code>os</code> key, the rule is default for non-specified platforms.


In the example above, on an OS X platform, the full download path would be
 https://libraries.minecraft.net/org/lwjgl/lwjgl/lwjgl-platform/2.9.1-nightly-20130708-debug3/lwjgl-platform-2.9.1-nightly-20130708-debug3-natives-osx.jar
The file would be extracted but the <code>META-INF</code> file would not be. Additionally, the file would only be downloaded if the computer was running OS X 10.5.

== Assets == 
The game itself downloads further resources from
 http://resources.download.minecraft.net/

An index is available at 
 https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/indexes/<index>.json 
where index is obtained from the 'assets' field in the versions.json, if this field is missing it defaults to '[https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/indexes/legacy.json legacy]'. Each resource in the file has a name (the field name of the resource object), a SHA1 hash, and a file size.  The client currently downloads all resources in the index from
 http://resources.download.minecraft.net/<first 2 hex letters of hash>/<whole hash>
and stores them in 
 .minecraft/assets/objects/<first 2 hex letters of hash>/<whole hash>
and a copy is stored in 
 .minecraft/assets/virtual/legacy/ 
in the old format for versions that don't support the new system (1.7.2 and below)
