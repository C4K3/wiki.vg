== Game ==
All available version of the game itself are listed on
  http://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/versions/versions.json

The jar file for a specific version is located at
  http://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/versions/<version>/<version>.jar

Some information on how to properly run said jar is available at
  http://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/versions/<version>/<version>.json

== Libraries ==
The libraries which can be used for all minecraft versions and are downloaded by the launcher are located at
  http://s3.amazonaws.com/MinecraftDownload/

The json file downloaded above is used in order to determine which libraries to download. Inside the file is a key, <code>libraries</code> which contains information about each library required.
Example:
<syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
{
  "name": "org.lwjgl.lwjgl:lwjgl-platform:2.9.1-nightly-20130708-debug3",
  "natives": {
    "linux": "natives-linux",
    "windows": "natives-windows",
    "osx": "natives-osx"
  },
  "extract": {
    "exclude": [
      "META-INF/"
    ]
  },
  "rules": [
    {
      "action": "allow",
      "os": {
        "name": "osx",
        "version": "^10\\.5\\.\\d$"
      }
    }
  ]
}
</syntaxhighlight>

The <code>name</code> key is used to determine the url from which to download the library from. The format of this string is <code><package>:<name>:<version></code> and can be turned into a path by replacing the periods in the package name with forward slashes and formatting a string with the template: <code><package>/<name>/<version>/<name>-<version>.jar</code>.

The <code>natives</code> key provides a string for each specific platform to be inserted between the .jar and the <version> of the filename, resulting in a filename with the format: <code><name>-<version>-<native-string>.jar</code>. This is applied to any file with the <code>natives</code> key.

The <code>extract</code> key provides rules for the extraction of the file.

The <code>rules</code> key is used to determine which platforms to download the file to. When the <code>action</code> is <code>allow</code>, the file will be downloaded to the platform stated in <code>os</code>. When the <code>action</code> is <code>disallow</code>, the file will not be downloaded to the platform stated in <code>os</code>. If there is no <code>os</code> key, the rule is default for non-specified platforms.

In the example above, on an OSX platform, the full download path would be <code>https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/libraries/org/lwjgl/lwjgl/lwjgl-platform/2.9.1-nightly-20130708-debug3/lwjgl-platform-2.9.1-nightly-20130708-debug3-natives-osx.jar</code>, the file would be extracted but the <code>META-INF</code> file would not be. Additionally, the file would only be downloaded if the computer was running OSX 10.5.


== Assets == 
The game itself downloads further resources from
  http://s3.amazonaws.com/MinecraftResources/

A list of all available resources is available as an XML file at the address above. These files do not have to be downloaded in order for the game to function properly.
